Barry, Sally asked me to forward this to you FYI.
A lot of people will be tied up  all day Feb 29 at this offsite.
She would, however, like to set up time to  meet with you in Houston on Wednesday, March 1.
Sally is available from 1:30  - 5:00 in the afternoon.
Please let me know if there is a one hour slot that  will work for you.
Thanks,

FYI - I had included Diane Seib and Melinda Whalen (from Calgary) in my  promotion memo from Energy Operations.
I believe that they both work under  Peggy Hedstrom in operational roles.
I am sure that they didn't mind having  their names included twice in promotional memos!
Peggy says that you and Juanita are headed to Calgary next week, and she  wondered if I would be coming.
I will be in South America in what should be  summer there.
I do plan to make a trip to Calgary soon.

Three weeks ago I started a 15 minute meeting in my office on Monday mornings  for a key group working on the commercialization effort of mid and back  office services.
Attendees are my key operations personnel involved, Todd  Busby (for a preview of what's to come), Rahil and Fred Philipson.
The  purpose of the meeting is to review progress on items agreed to for the  previous week and to establish priorities for the current week.
I have been  capturing all of this on the white board in my offi

The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.
Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500  employees in the Enron building.
Do you want all of them to choose one of  the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule  one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this  segment of Net Works?
I have noted below the approximate number of employees  per floor (including only those floors with a

Expect Patti to contact you about setting aside 15 minutes each Monday to  meet in my office as a team to quickly prioritize tasks for the week  regarding the commercialization of our services.
While we will certainly  draw upon the knowledge of  others within Operations, we will consider this  to be the core resource team.
We want to continue to build momentum for this  effort.
Knowing that we are all stretched in managing the day-to-day  business, this quick focus each week on the key tasks wi

An update on two of the items that we discussed before you went out of town:  Due Diligence Teams for Acquisitions Identified  I have worked with my operations controllers in EWS and have identified a  short list of individuals that we could use in the due diligence efforts on  potential acquisitions.
We have identified our target teams for due  diligence efforts around commodities.
While each person on the list has  other duties currently, all have back ups that would allow them to be devoted

FYI if you haven't already heard...........A quick update on PJM:  1) GPU: The PA PUC ruled in favor of the First Energy merger, but deferred a rate increase.
Collaberative meeting are supposed to be taking place over the next month, but Enron's regulatory view is that a setlement will not be able to be reached.
The question is if First Energy is still interested in persuing the merger if a rate increase does not occur.
If the merger does not occur, I think this increases our chances of a deal t

These procedures outline the definitions of certificated/sustainable, operational/short-term sustainable and operational non-sustainable capacity and how we will determine how much and when capacity is available in each of these categories.
