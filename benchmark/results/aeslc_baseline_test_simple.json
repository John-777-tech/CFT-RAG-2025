    "answer": "It seems the actual content of the email titled \"Expense Reports Awaiting Your Approval\" is missing from the provided information. Please share the full text of the email, and I’ll be able to generate a concise summary for you.\n\n\nIf you had included the email, for example, a sample summary might look like this (assuming a typical scenario):  \n\"This email notifies the recipient that several expense reports (e.g., 3 submissions from the sales team dated 10/05/2024) are pending their approval in the company’s expense management system. It reminds them to review the reports by EOD 10/12/2024 to ensure timely reimbursement for employees, and provides a direct link to access the system for approval.\"  \n\nBut without the actual email content, I can’t create an accurate summary. Please provide the email text!",
