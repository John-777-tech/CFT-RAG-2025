This follows the ASCII code pattern where the binary/octal values represent the ASCII codes of the Arabic numeral characters.\n- For the given triples:\n  - Binary 0011 0100 converts to decimal 52, which is the ASCII code for the character '4'.\n  - Octal 064 converts to decimal 52, which is also the ASCII code for '4'. Thus, both values correspond to the Arabic numeral 4.\nThis aligns with the structure and logic of the original chunks.\n---\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe binary number 0011 0100 corresponds to an Arabic numeral glyph of 4.
