    "question": "A 26-year-old G1P0 woman presents to her primary care physician’s office with feelings of anxiety and trouble with sleep. She finds it difficult initiating sleep, occasionally has palpitations, and feels fatigued. She denies having similar symptoms in the past or starting any new medications or illicit drugs.

On physical exam, the patient is mildly diaphoretic. The skin is warm and the thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged with thyroid bruits. Laboratory studies are significant for a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.01 µU/mL (normal is 0.5-5.0 µU/mL) and an elevated free thyroxine (FT4) that is inappropriate for her pregnancy.

    "question": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of intermittent loose stools and a 1.2-kg (2.6-lb) weight loss. She immigrated to the US from Uganda 6 weeks ago. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. The liver is firm and palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin, and the spleen is palpable just below the left costal margin. Her leukocyte count is 12,800/mm3 (12% eosinophils). Stool culture shows several oval-shaped eggs with lateral spines. Microscopic examination of a liver biopsy specimen shows granulomatous inflammation with periportal fibrosis. Exposure to which of the following is most likely to have played a role in the development of this patient's symptoms?",
    "answer": "Contact with freshwater contaminated with Schistosoma mansoni cercariae.  \n\n(Note: The patient's presentation—oval eggs with lateral spines, eosinophilia, hepatosplenomegaly, granulomatous liver fibrosis—points to Schistosoma mansoni infection, transmitted via contact with freshwater containing its infective cercariae, common in Uganda.)\n\n\n**Answer:** Schistosoma mansoni (or contaminated freshwater with its cercariae; the most direct answer based on the case is Schistosoma mansoni exposure via freshwater).  \n\nBut since the question expects a concise answer, the key is Schistosoma mansoni, so:  \n\n**Schistosoma mansoni**  \n\n(Alternatively, if the question's options included \"contaminated freshwater\", that's the exposure, but given the case details, the parasite is the cause, so the exposure is to that parasite's infective form in freshwater.)  \n\nFinal concise answer: **Schistosoma mansoni** (or **contaminated freshwater**—but given the context, Schistosoma mansoni is the specific agent, so that's the answer.)  \n\nWait, but let's confirm: The question says \"exposure to which of the following\"—so the exposure is to the source. So the answer is **Freshwater contaminated with Schistosoma mansoni cercariae**—but to make it简略 (as per the user's instruction: answer to be简略), **Contaminated freshwater** (since that's the exposure type).  \n\nYes, that's better: **Contaminated freshwater** (because that's the exposure the patient had, leading to schistosomiasis).  \n\nSo the final answer:  \n\n**Contaminated freshwater**",
