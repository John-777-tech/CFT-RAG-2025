    "question": "A 26-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was a restrained passenger. On arrival, she is lethargic and incoherent. She has severe facial lacerations and is in respiratory distress. Her pulse is 130/min, respirations are 29/min, and blood pressure is 90/58 mm Hg.

    "answer": "The girl's condition is Tetralogy of Fallot, a cyanotic congenital heart defect characterized by pulmonary outflow obstruction, right ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular septal defect, and overriding aorta. Right-to-left shunting through the ventricular septal defect due to increased right ventricular pressure causes central cyanosis.
