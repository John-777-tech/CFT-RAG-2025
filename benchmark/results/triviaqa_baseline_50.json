    "answer": "Based on the provided information and the 12-year cycle of the Chinese zodiac:\n\n1. The info links 1994 with \"Pekingese\" (a dog breed), implying 1994 is the Year of the Dog.  \n2. To find the zodiac for 19969:  \n   - Calculate the difference: 19969 - 1994 = 17975 years.  \n   - 17975 ÷ 12 leaves a remainder of 11 (since 12×1497=17964, 17975-17964=11).  \n   - Moving 11 positions forward from Dog in the zodiac cycle (Rat→Ox→Tiger→Rabbit→Dragon→Snake→Horse→Goat→Monkey→Rooster→Dog→Pig):  \n     Dog +11 positions = Rooster (since Dog is 11th, adding11 gives 22, mod12=10, which corresponds to Rooster in standard order).  \n\nAnswer: Rooster.",
