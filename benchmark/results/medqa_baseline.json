    "question": "A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?",
    "answer": "The correct next action for the resident is to tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake.

This is a classic finding for **aortic stenosis (AS)**—a fixed valvular obstruction where the aortic valve is narrowed.\n\n\n### Step 2: Effect of standing from supine  \nStanding reduces **venous return** (due to gravity pulling blood to the lower extremities), leading to a decrease in **left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV)** (preload).  \n\n\n### Step 3: Impact on AS murmur  \nThe intensity of the AS murmur depends on the **flow through the stenotic valve** and the **pressure gradient across it**. When preload decreases (standing):  \n- Less blood is available to flow through the narrowed aortic valve during systole.  \n- This reduces the pressure gradient and flow, leading to a **decrease in murmur intensity**.  \n\n\n### Key Distinction  \nThis contrasts with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), where decreased preload (standing/Valsalva) *increases* the murmur (smaller LV cavity worsens outflow tract obstruction). However, HCM murmur typically radiates to the axilla (not carotids) and is best heard at the apex/lower sternal border—ruling it out here.\n\n\n**Answer:** The murmur decreases in intensity.  \n\n\\boxed{The murmur decreases in intensity}",

    "question": "A microbiologist is studying the emergence of a virulent strain of the virus. After a detailed study of the virus and its life cycle, he proposes a theory: Initially, a host cell is co-infected with 2 viruses from the same virus family. Within the host cell, concomitant production of various genome segments from both viruses occurs. Ultimately, the different genome segments from the viruses are packaged into a unique and novel virus particle. The newly formed virus particle is both stable and viable and is a new strain from the virus family that caused the outbreak of infection. Which of the following viruses is capable of undergoing the above-mentioned process?",
    "answer": "To solve this question, we first identify the key process described: **viral reassortment**. This occurs when two viruses with segmented genomes co-infect the same host cell, leading to the packaging of mixed genome segments into new virions, producing a novel strain. Reassortment is only possible in viruses with segmented genomes.\n\n\n### Key Analysis:\nThe question asks for a virus capable of reassortment. A classic example of such a virus is **Influenza A virus** (family Orthomyxoviridae), which has an 8-segmented negative-sense RNA genome. Reassortment between different Influenza A strains (e.g., human, avian, swine) is responsible for the emergence of new virulent strains (e.g., H1N1 pandemic strains).\n\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe virus capable of the described process is **Influenza A virus**.\n\n\nAnswer: Influenza A virus.",

When the gynecologist asks her about the consumption of any other medications, she mentions that she was placed on treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) 2 months ago. Her current anti-TB regimen includes rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the failure of oral contraceptives in this patient?",
    "answer": "The mechanism explaining the failure of oral contraceptives in this patient is the induction of CYP3A4 by rifampin, which leads to decreased serum levels of ethinylestradiol and progesterone (as stated in Chunk 27). \n\nRifampin, an anti-tuberculosis medication, induces the CYP3A4 enzyme—this increases the metabolism of ethinylestradiol and progesterone (the active components of oral contraceptives), reducing their serum concentrations below the threshold required for contraceptive efficacy, thus resulting in pregnancy despite regular use of oral contraceptives.\n\n\n**Answer:** Induction of CYP3A4 by rifampin leading to decreased serum levels of ethinylestradiol and progesterone.",

    "question": "A 4-year-old previously healthy boy presents with 4 days of intermittent vomiting and 5-6 daily loose stools. His mother noted bloody stools and decreased oral intake of food and water over the last 24 hours. He is normally in daycare; however, he has been home for the past 3 days. On physical exam his temperature is 102.2°F (39°C), blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 22/min and O2 saturation is 99% on room air. He has dry mucous membranes. On abdominal exam you note diffuse tenderness to palpation without rebound or guarding. There are no masses, hepatosplenomegaly, and bowel sounds are hyperactive. Ultrasound of the right lower quadrant is negative for appendicitis. Stool is guaiac positive. He receives 15mg/kg acetaminophen and fluids are started.

    "answer": "To determine the likely lab findings in this patient, we first identify their underlying condition:\n\n\n### **Step 1: Clinical Diagnosis**  \nThe patient (4-year-old boy) presents with:  \n- Bloody diarrhea (Shiga toxin-producing *E. coli* [STEC] infection is a top cause in this age group),  \n- Fever, dehydration,  \n- Subsequent lower extremity weakness/tingling, reduced reflexes (neurological involvement from Shiga toxin),  \n- No appendicitis (ruled out by ultrasound).  \n\nThis scenario is consistent with **STEC-induced Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)**—a complication of STEC infection (e.g., *E. coli* O157:H7) characterized by a triad of:  \n1. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA),  \n2. Thrombocytopenia,  \n3. Acute kidney injury (AKI).  \n\n\n### **Step 2: Key Lab Findings**  \nAssociated lab abnormalities include:  \n- **Peripheral smear**: Presence of schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells, hallmark of MAHA),  \n- **CBC**: Low hemoglobin (anemia), low platelets (thrombocytopenia),  \n- **Chemistry**: Elevated creatinine/BUN (AKI), elevated LDH (from red cell lysis), low haptoglobin (bound to free hemoglobin in MAHA).  \n\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThe most likely lab findings are **schistocytes on peripheral smear**, **thrombocytopenia**, or **elevated serum creatinine** (all core features of HUS).\n\n\n**Answer:** Presence of schistocytes on peripheral blood smear (or thrombocytopenia/elevated creatinine, depending on options—these are the classic lab markers for STEC-induced HUS).  \n\n(Note: If options included these, any of the above would be correct; the most specific is schistocytes.)  \n\n\\boxed{Schistocytes on peripheral blood smear} (assuming this is an option; if not, \\boxed{Thrombocytopenia} or \\boxed{Elevated serum creatinine} are also correct).  \n\nBut given standard test questions, the most common answer here is **schistocytes** or **thrombocytopenia**.

    "question": "A 3-week-old male newborn is brought to the physician because of an inward turning of his left forefoot. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation by cesarean section because of breech presentation. The pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios. Examination shows concavity of the medial border of the left foot with a skin crease just below the ball of the great toe. The lateral border of the left foot is convex. The heel is in neutral position. Tickling the lateral border of the foot leads to correction of the deformity. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the left foot shows an increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    "answer": "To answer this question, we first identify the patient’s condition and then determine the appropriate management:\n\n\n### Step 1: Diagnose the condition  \nThe patient is a 3-week-old infant with **flexible metatarsus adductus**—a common congenital foot deformity characterized by:  \n- Inward turning of the forefoot (concave medial border, convex lateral border).  \n- Neutral heel position (unlike clubfoot, where the heel is pointed downward).  \n- Flexible deformity (corrected by tickling the lateral foot border).  \n- X-ray finding of increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsals (consistent with metatarsus adductus).  \n\n\n### Step 2: Management of flexible metatarsus adductus  \nFor flexible cases (passively correctable), the **first-line management** is **parental education on gentle passive stretching exercises** (e.g., stretching the forefoot outward several times daily). Most flexible cases resolve spontaneously with these exercises. Rigid cases may require casting, but this is not needed here.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe most appropriate next step is to **teach the parents passive stretching exercises for the affected foot**.\n\n\nAnswer: Instruct the parents to perform passive stretching exercises of the forefoot outward. (Note: This aligns with standard guidelines for flexible metatarsus adductus.)  \n\n(If this were a multiple-choice question, the correct option would reflect this conservative, parent-led stretching approach.)  \n**Final Answer** (as per standard practice): Instruct parents on passive stretching exercises of the forefoot.  \n\\boxed{Instruct parents on passive stretching exercises of the forefoot}  \n\n(Note: Adjust the boxed text to match the exact option wording if provided; this is the core correct action.)",

    "question": "A 27-year-old woman presents to the office with concerns about her long struggle with her physical appearance since adolescence. She says she has always been \"large\" and was constantly targeted by her classmates and coworkers for being so. Her main concern at the moment is her acne and unwanted facial hair on her upper lip, for which she often visits a local spa. She has tried numerous diet plans, exercise regimens, and cosmetic products with little to no effect. Recently, she underwent a glucose tolerance test that showed a plasma glucose level of 160 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L) after 2 hours of a 75 g dose of oral glucose.

    "question": "A one-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for bilious vomiting. The patient has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium. He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The patient’s mother received routine prenatal care and declined first trimester screening. She subsequently underwent a quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation that demonstrated decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. Her last ultrasound prior to onset of labor demonstrated an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm. The patient’s two older siblings are both healthy. The patient’s temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 58/37 mmHg, pulse is 166/min, and respirations are 38/min. On physical exam, the patient is in moderate distress.

    "answer": "To determine the most likely etiology of the newborn’s presentation, we analyze the key clinical and prenatal findings:\n\n\n### **Key Prenatal & Newborn Findings**  \n1. **Prenatal markers**: Quadruple screen showed **decreased AFP, increased β-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, increased inhibin A**—classic for **trisomy 21 (Down syndrome)**.  \n2. **Newborn symptoms**:  \n   - Bilious vomiting  \n   - No meconium passage at 1 day old  \n   - Firm, distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds  \n3. **Associated GI conditions in Down syndrome**: Both duodenal atresia and Hirschsprung disease are common, but the newborn’s symptoms favor **Hirschsprung disease**.  \n\n\n### **Why Hirschsprung Disease?**  \n- **Failure to pass meconium**: A hallmark of Hirschsprung disease (most newborns pass meconium within 24-48 hours; 1 day without passage is abnormal).  \n- **Bilious vomiting**: Occurs with significant functional obstruction from aganglionic segments of the colon.  \n- **Trisomy 21 association**: Hirschsprung disease is ~10x more common in Down syndrome than the general population.  \n\n\n### **Why Not Duodenal Atresia?**  \nWhile duodenal atresia is linked to Down syndrome and polyhydramnios (seen here with AFI=28 cm), it typically causes **double-bubble sign on ultrasound** and may allow small amounts of meconium passage (since lower GI tract meconium is present). The newborn’s lack of meconium passage makes this less likely.  \n\n\n**Answer: Hirschsprung disease (aganglionic megacolon)**.  \n\n(Note: If options included \"Trisomy 21\" as an underlying cause, it would be relevant, but the immediate etiology of the GI symptoms is Hirschsprung disease.)\n\n\n\\boxed{Hirschsprung disease}",

    "answer": "To determine the area with the lowest oxygen content at both rest and exercise, we analyze the oxygenation status of blood in different circulatory regions:\n\n\n### Key Background  \nOxygenated blood flows through the left heart (left atrium/ventricle) and systemic arteries to tissues. Tissues extract oxygen, producing deoxygenated blood that returns via systemic veins (vena cava) to the **right side of the heart** (right atrium → right ventricle) and then to the **pulmonary artery** (which carries deoxygenated blood to the lungs for reoxygenation).  \n\n\n### Analysis at Rest and Exercise  \n- **Rest**: Systemic venous blood (and right heart/pulmonary artery) has low oxygen content (~70-75% saturation).  \n- **Exercise**: Tissues use more oxygen, so systemic venous blood (and right heart/pulmonary artery) has even lower oxygen content (~30-40% saturation).  \n\nAt both time points, the right side of the heart and pulmonary artery contain the most deoxygenated blood in the body. Among these, the **pulmonary artery** is a classic answer for the area with the lowest oxygen content (consistent with standard physiology questions).  \n\n\n**Answer: Pulmonary artery** (or right ventricle, though pulmonary artery is more commonly cited in such contexts).  \n\nBut since the question expects a specific area, the most precise answer is:  \n\nPulmonary artery.",

    "answer": "To determine the most likely underlying cause, we analyze the **urine findings** and clinical clues provided:\n\n\n### Key Clinical & Laboratory Clues  \n- Jaundice + generalized pruritus (bile acid accumulation in skin).  \n- Urinalysis: **elevated bilirubin** (conjugated, water-soluble → excreted in urine) + **low urobilinogen** (reduced gut bacteria action on bile bilirubin).  \n\n\n### Pathophysiology of Jaundice Types  \nWe rule out other jaundice categories:  \n1. **Pre-hepatic (hemolysis):** Unconjugated bilirubin ↑, no bilirubinuria (unconjugated is insoluble), urobilinogen ↑ (more bile into gut). **Does not match.**  \n2. **Hepatic (hepatitis/cirrhosis):** May have bilirubinuria, but urobilinogen is often ↑ (liver can’t reabsorb urobilinogen efficiently). **Does not match low urobilinogen.**  \n3. **Post-hepatic (obstructive):** Bile flow blocked (e.g., common bile duct stone/tumor).  \n   - Conjugated bilirubin builds up → bilirubinuria.  \n   - No bile enters gut → no gut bacteria to make urobilinogen → low urobilinogen in urine.  \n   - Pruritus (bile acid accumulation) is classic here. **Perfect match.**  \n\n\n### Most Likely Cause  \nThe findings point to **obstructive jaundice**. Common causes in a 65-year-old man include:  \n- Choledocholithiasis (stone in common bile duct).  \n- Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (head of pancreas, blocking bile duct).  \n\n\n**Answer:** Common bile duct obstruction (e.g., choledocholithiasis or pancreatic carcinoma of the head).  \n\n(Note: If options were provided, the correct choice would align with post-hepatic obstruction.)\n\n\n**Final Answer**  \nCommon bile duct obstruction (e.g., from a stone or pancreatic adenocarcinoma of the head).  \n\n(If forced to select a specific example, **choledocholithiasis** is a frequent cause, but **pancreatic carcinoma** is also a key consideration in older adults.)  \n\nFor the purpose of a concise answer (assuming standard exam options), the most likely answer is:  \n\n**Common bile duct obstruction**  \n\nOr, if pancreatic carcinoma is an option: **Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (head).**  \n\nBut given typical exam framing, the most direct answer is:  \n\n**Obstructive jaundice due to common bile duct obstruction.**  \n\n(However, in many USMLE-style questions, the answer is **Pancreatic adenocarcinoma** for an older adult with these findings, or **Choledocholithiasis** if stones are a listed option.)  \n\nAssuming standard options, the answer is:  \n\n**Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (head)** or **Choledocholithiasis** (depending on options).  \n\nBut since the question expects a definitive answer based on classic findings, the best choice is:  \n\n**Common bile duct obstruction**\n\n\n\\boxed{Common bile duct obstruction}  \n\n(Alternatively, if pancreatic carcinoma is the intended answer: \\boxed{Pancreatic adenocarcinoma})  \n\nBut given the most frequent exam scenario for this question type, the answer is:  \n\n\\boxed{Common bile duct obstruction}",

    "question": "A healthy 19-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of painless “blisters” in his mouth. He reports that he noticed a white film on his tongue and the sides of his mouth 2 days ago while brushing his teeth. The film was easily brushed off. He also complains of a bitter metallic taste in his mouth but otherwise denies pain, burning, dysphagia, or hoarseness. He is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. He is a competitive swimmer and has had 8 sexual partners in the past year. He intermittently uses barrier protection. On exam, he is well-appearing and in no acute distress. His oral examination demonstrates patches of white pseudomembranes that can be wiped away to reveal erythematous mucosa. A medication with which of the following mechanisms of action is most appropriate in this patient?",
    "answer": "To answer this question, we first diagnose the patient’s condition based on clinical features, then identify the mechanism of the appropriate treatment.\n\n\n### Step 1: Diagnose the Condition  \nThe patient presents with **oral candidiasis (thrush)**—key clues include:  \n- White pseudomembranes that are easily wiped away, revealing erythematous mucosa.  \n- Painless lesions, bitter metallic taste.  \n- Risk factors: Intermittent barrier use during sexual activity (though oral candidiasis is not sexually transmitted, it may occur in immunocompetent individuals with subtle risk factors, or the patient may have unrecognized immune compromise, but the clinical picture is classic for thrush).  \n\n\n### Step 2: Identify Treatment Mechanism  \nOral candidiasis is caused by *Candida albicans* (a yeast). First-line treatments are antifungals:  \n- **Azoles (e.g., fluconazole):** Inhibit fungal ergosterol synthesis (by blocking lanosterol 14α-demethylase).  \n- **Polyenes (e.g., nystatin):** Bind to fungal ergosterol, disrupting cell membrane integrity and causing leakage of intracellular contents.  \n\n\n### Note on Provided Chunks  \nThe provided chunks do not directly include antifungal mechanisms, but the clinical diagnosis and standard treatment guidelines lead to the correct mechanism.  \n\n\n**Answer:** Inhibition of fungal ergosterol synthesis (or binding to fungal ergosterol, depending on the specific medication).  \n\nSince the question asks for the mechanism of the most appropriate medication, the most common first-line oral treatment (fluconazole) acts via **inhibition of ergosterol synthesis**.\n\n\n\\boxed{Inhibition of fungal ergosterol synthesis}",

    "answer": "To determine the most likely diagnosis, we analyze the key clinical and imaging findings in the context of high-speed motor vehicle collision (MVC) trauma:\n\n\n### **Key Findings**  \n- **Trauma context**: High-speed MVC (restrained passenger, significant force).  \n- **Vital signs**: Tachycardia (130/min), hypotension (90/58 mmHg, shock), tachypnea (29/min), hypoxemia (70% O₂ sat).  \n- **Chest exam**: Dullness to percussion + decreased breath sounds (left lung base → possible hemothorax).  \n- **Chest X-ray**:  \n  - Fractured left second rib (high rib fracture = marker of severe thoracic trauma).  \n  - Widened mediastinum (classic red flag for aortic injury).  \n  - Deviated NG tube (suggests mediastinal shift from hematoma/bleeding).  \n- **Clue from provided chunks**: **CT angiography of the chest** (gold standard test for aortic injury).  \n\n\n### **Most Likely Diagnosis**  \n**Traumatic thoracic aortic injury** (e.g., aortic transection or dissection).  \n\n\n### **Rationale**  \nHigh-speed deceleration trauma (MVC) causes shear forces at the aorta’s fixed points (ligamentum arteriosum), leading to injury. This explains:  \n- **Widened mediastinum**: Mediastinal hematoma from aortic bleeding.  \n- **Shock**: Internal hemorrhage (mediastinal or pleural space).  \n- **High rib fracture**: Associated with severe thoracic trauma (upper ribs are protected, so fracture implies significant force).  \n- **CT angiography clue**: This test is indicated to confirm aortic injury, aligning with the provided chunks.  \n\n\n**Answer**: Traumatic thoracic aortic injury (or specific subtypes like aortic transection/dissection, depending on standard options).  \n\n*(Note: The provided chunks highlight CT angiography of the chest as the next step, which further supports this diagnosis.)*  \n\n**Final Diagnosis**: Traumatic thoracic aortic injury.",

She finds it difficult initiating sleep, occasionally has palpitations, and feels fatigued. She denies having similar symptoms in the past or starting any new medications or illicit drugs. She is currently 10 weeks pregnant and is closely followed by her obstetrician. Her temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 125/70 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical exam, the patient is mildly diaphoretic. The skin is warm and the thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged with thyroid bruits. Laboratory studies are significant for a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.01 µU/mL (normal is 0.5-5.0 µU/mL) and an elevated free thyroxine (FT4) that is inappropriate for her pregnancy. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?",
    "answer": "To determine the best treatment option, we first analyze the case and diagnosis, then apply pregnancy-specific guidelines for hyperthyroidism:\n\n\n### **Step 1: Diagnosis**  \nThe patient presents with **hyperthyroidism in early pregnancy** (10 weeks):  \n- Clinical features: Anxiety, palpitations, diaphoresis, warm skin, diffusely enlarged thyroid with bruits (classic for **Graves’ disease**, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy).  \n- Labs: Low TSH (0.01 µU/mL, normal 0.5-5.0) + elevated FT4 (inappropriate for pregnancy) confirm hyperthyroidism.  \n\n\n### **Step 2: Treatment Guidelines for Hyperthyroidism in Pregnancy**  \nKey considerations for medication safety:  \n- **Radioactive iodine**: Contraindicated (crosses placenta, damages fetal thyroid).  \n- **Surgery**: Reserved for refractory cases (not first-line).  \n- **Antithyroid drugs (ATDs)**:  \n  - **First trimester**: **Propylthiouracil (PTU)** is preferred. Methimazole (MMI) has higher teratogenic risks (e.g., aplasia cutis, esophageal atresia) in early pregnancy.  \n  - **Second/third trimesters**: Switch to MMI to avoid PTU’s risk of severe hepatotoxicity.  \n- **Beta-blockers**: Adjunctive for symptom relief (palpitations), but not definitive treatment.  \n\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nSince the patient is in the **first trimester** (10 weeks), the best treatment is **Propylthiouracil (PTU)**.\n\n\n**Answer: Propylthiouracil**",
