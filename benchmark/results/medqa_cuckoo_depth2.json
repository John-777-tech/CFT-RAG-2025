    "question": "A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?",
    "answer": "To address this scenario, we must prioritize **ethical principles** (veracity, patient autonomy, integrity in documentation) and **professional responsibility**:\n\n\n### Key Analysis  \nThe attending’s instruction to omit the complication from the operative report and withhold information from the patient violates two critical obligations:  \n1. **Accurate documentation**: The operative report is a legal/medical record; omitting a complication (even minor) misleads future providers and compromises patient care.  \n2. **Patient autonomy**: Patients have a right to full information about their care, including unplanned events—even if no harm is expected—so they can make informed decisions about follow-up.  \n\n\n### Correct Next Action  \nThe resident’s first step should be to **engage in a respectful discussion with the attending** to clarify concerns:  \n- Explain why documenting the complication is necessary (for medical record integrity and future care).  \n- Advocate for informing the patient (to uphold their autonomy and trust).  \n\nThis approach aligns with professional standards: resolving conflicts with superiors first through open communication before escalating further.\n\n\n**Answer:** The resident should discuss with the attending the importance of documenting the complication in the operative report and informing the patient, emphasizing ethical and legal obligations to maintain accurate records and respect the patient’s right to information.  \n\n(Note: If the attending persists in refusing, the resident would need to escalate to a higher authority (e.g., department leadership) to ensure compliance with standards, but the *next* step is direct communication with the attending.)\n\n\n\\boxed{Discuss with the attending the need to document the complication in the operative report and inform the patient}",

    "answer": "To answer this question, we first identify the drug responsible for the patient’s symptoms, then determine its anticancer mechanism:\n\n\n### Step 1: Identify the causative drug  \nThe patient has bladder transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) and presents with **tinnitus + sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL)** after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These are classic toxicities of **cisplatin**—a platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent widely used in bladder TCC (e.g., in regimens like GC: gemcitabine + cisplatin or MVAC). Cisplatin is well-known for ototoxicity due to accumulation in cochlear outer hair cells, causing oxidative damage and hearing impairment.\n\n\n### Step 2: Mechanism of cisplatin’s anticancer effect  \nCisplatin exerts its anticancer activity by **forming covalent cross-links in DNA**:  \n- It binds to guanine residues in DNA, creating intra-strand (between adjacent bases) and inter-strand (between DNA strands) cross-links.  \n- These cross-links block DNA replication and transcription, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells.\n\n\n**Answer:** Formation of DNA cross-links.\n\n\n\\boxed{Formation of DNA cross-links}",

The pain radiates to the epigastric area. He has a 5-year history of untreated hypertension. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 5 years and started abusing cocaine 2 weeks before his emergency room visit. The patient is diaphoretic and in marked distress. What should be the first step in management?",
    "answer": "The first step in management for this patient with suspected cocaine-induced chest pain and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is the administration of benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam, diazepam).  \n\n### Rationale:  \nThe patient’s presentation (progressively worsening chest pain, diaphoresis, distress) combined with recent cocaine abuse (a potent sympathomimetic) suggests cocaine-induced myocardial ischemia/ACS. Cocaine increases sympathetic tone, leading to tachycardia, hypertension, and coronary vasoconstriction—all of which raise myocardial oxygen demand and reduce supply.  \n\nBenzodiazepines are first-line therapy here because they:  \n1. Reduce sympathetic nervous system activation, mitigating the tachycardia, hypertension, and vasoconstriction caused by cocaine.  \n2. Lower myocardial oxygen demand, directly addressing the underlying pathophysiology of the chest pain.  \n\nWhile aspirin is indicated for ACS, benzodiazepines take priority in cocaine-associated cases to target the sympathomimetic effects driving the ischemia.\n\n\n**Answer:** Administer benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam or diazepam) to reduce sympathetic tone and alleviate cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction and myocardial oxygen demand.  \n(If a single term is preferred: Benzodiazepine administration)",

    "question": "A 20-year-old man comes to the physician because of worsening gait unsteadiness and bilateral hearing loss for 1 month. He has had intermittent tingling sensations on both cheeks over this time period. He has no history of serious medical illness and takes no medications. Audiometry shows bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Genetic evaluation shows a mutation of a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 that encodes merlin. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions?",
    "answer": "To answer this question, we first identify the patient’s condition based on the clinical and genetic findings:  \n\n### Key Clinical & Genetic Clues  \n- 20-year-old man with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, gait unsteadiness, and cheek tingling.  \n- Genetic mutation: Tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 encoding **merlin** (schwannomin).  \n\nThis is consistent with **Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2)**, a condition caused by mutations in the NF2 gene (22q12).  \n\n\n### NF2-Associated Conditions  \nNF2 is characterized by an increased risk of several CNS tumors and ocular findings. The most classic associations include:  \n1. **Bilateral vestibular schwannomas** (acoustic neuromas) → explains the patient’s bilateral hearing loss.  \n2. **Meningiomas** (common, often multiple).  \n3. **Spinal ependymomas**.  \n4. **Schwannomas of other cranial nerves** (e.g., trigeminal schwannoma → cheek tingling).  \n5. **Juvenile cataracts** (ocular finding).  \n\n\n### Likely Answer  \nGiven the question asks for an additional condition the patient is at increased risk for (beyond the already present hearing loss), the most common and classic choice in standard clinical questions is **Meningioma**.  \n\n\n**Answer: Meningioma**",

    "question": "A 47-year-old executive schedules an appointment his physician for a routine medical check-up. He currently has no complaints and claims to be “as fit as a fiddle.” The physical examination findings are unremarkable, except for a mid-systolic murmur heard in the 2nd left intercostal space that radiates to the carotids on auscultation. The physician instructs the patient to stand from a supine position with the stethoscope still placed on his chest. Which of the following changes would occur with this maneuver?",
    "answer": "To answer this question, we analyze the key findings and the effect of the maneuver step by step:\n\n\n### Step 1: Identify the murmur  \nThe patient has a **mid-systolic murmur in the 2nd left intercostal space radiating to the carotids**. This is classic for **aortic stenosis (AS)**, a fixed valvular obstruction.\n\n\n### Step 2: Effect of standing from supine  \nStanding reduces venous return → decreases left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV, preload).\n\n\n### Step 3: How preload affects AS murmur  \nAS is a fixed obstruction. A decrease in preload (LVEDV) reduces the volume of blood passing through the narrowed aortic valve per heartbeat. This leads to a **reduction in the intensity of the AS murmur** (less blood flow through the fixed stenosis = softer murmur).\n\n\n### Distinction from other murmurs  \n- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM): Murmur increases with standing (dynamic obstruction worsens as LV cavity shrinks), but HCM radiates to the apex (not carotids).  \n- Pulmonic stenosis: Radiates to the left shoulder (not carotids).  \n\n\n**Answer: The murmur intensity decreases.**\n\n\n\\boxed{The murmur intensity decreases}",

    "question": "A microbiologist is studying the emergence of a virulent strain of the virus. After a detailed study of the virus and its life cycle, he proposes a theory: Initially, a host cell is co-infected with 2 viruses from the same virus family. Within the host cell, concomitant production of various genome segments from both viruses occurs. Ultimately, the different genome segments from the viruses are packaged into a unique and novel virus particle. The newly formed virus particle is both stable and viable and is a new strain from the virus family that caused the outbreak of infection. Which of the following viruses is capable of undergoing the above-mentioned process?",
    "answer": "To answer this question, we first identify the process described: **genome reassortment**. This occurs when two viruses with **segmented genomes** co-infect the same host cell, leading to the shuffling of their genome segments into new virus particles—producing novel, viable strains.\n\n\n### Key Background:  \nReassortment requires a **segmented genome** (genetic material split into multiple separate pieces). Among common viruses, the classic example of a virus capable of reassortment is **Influenza A virus**, which has an 8-segmented single-stranded RNA genome. This process is responsible for \"antigenic shift\" in influenza, leading to new pandemic strains (e.g., H1N1, H5N1).\n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe virus capable of the described process is **Influenza A virus**.\n\n\n**Answer:** Influenza A virus.

    "answer": "To determine which diagnosis should be excluded first, we analyze the key clinical details and prioritize the most serious condition:\n\n\n### Key Clinical Findings  \n- **Patient profile**: 59yo overweight woman with recurrent cholelithiasis (gallstones, a major risk factor for gallbladder cancer), family history of abdominal cancer, and acute severe abdominal/back pain with nausea/vomiting.  \n- **Imaging**: CT shows a **calcified mass near the gallbladder** (not just stones).  \n- **Vitals/Exam**: Normal temperature, unremarkable physical exam (no acute signs like Murphy’s sign for cholecystitis).  \n\n\n### Critical Considerations  \nThe most serious diagnosis to exclude first is **gallbladder carcinoma** for the following reasons:  \n1. **Risk factors**: Cholelithiasis (strongest risk factor), age >50, female gender, overweight status, and family history of abdominal cancer.  \n2. **Imaging**: A calcified mass near the gallbladder is not typical of benign conditions like porcelain gallbladder (wall calcification) or simple stones; it raises concern for a malignant tumor.  \n3. **Severity**: Gallbladder carcinoma is aggressive, with poor prognosis if not detected early—ruling it out immediately is critical.  \n\n\n### Other Exclusions  \nAcute cholecystitis is less likely (no fever/tenderness). Porcelain gallbladder is a risk factor for cancer but not an acute threat.

    "question": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician’s office for a follow-up visit. He was diagnosed with asthma when he was 3 years old and has since been on treatment for the condition. He is currently on a β-agonist inhaler because of exacerbation of his symptoms. He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack. The targeted mediator favors the class switching of antibodies. A reduction in this mechanism will eventually reduce the exaggerated response observed during his asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen. Which of the following mediators is described in this experimental study?",
    "answer": "To determine the mediator targeted in the experimental therapy, we analyze the key details from the question:\n\n\n### Key Observations:  \nThe boy’s asthma is **allergic** (triggered by pollen, seasonal, IgE-mediated).

After performing a complete physical examination and a screening test for pregnancy, her gynecologist informs her that she is pregnant. She is very surprised as she has been taking oral contraceptives regularly. When the gynecologist asks her about the consumption of any other medications, she mentions that she was placed on treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) 2 months ago.

    "question": "A 65-year-old woman schedules an appointment with her physician for evaluation of weight loss and weakness. The weakness is more noticeable when climbing stairs and combing hair. The weakness improves after brief exercise. She also has bladder incontinence for the past 4 weeks and was given an anticholinesterase agent with no improvement. What is the most likely cause of the symptoms?",
    "answer": "To determine the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms, let’s analyze the key findings and match them to the relevant condition:\n\n\n### **Key Symptoms & Clues**  \n1. **Proximal weakness (stairs, combing hair) that improves with brief exercise**: This is a hallmark of **presynaptic neuromuscular junction dysfunction**.  \n2. **Weight loss**: Suggests possible underlying malignancy.  \n3. **Bladder incontinence**: Indicates autonomic dysfunction.  \n4. **No improvement with anticholinesterase agents**: Rules out postsynaptic disorders like myasthenia gravis (MG), where anticholinesterases are effective.  \n\n\n### **Diagnosis: Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS)**  \nLEMS is a presynaptic neuromuscular junction disorder caused by antibodies against **voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC)** in presynaptic terminals.  \n\n- **Mechanism**: Reduced acetylcholine (ACh) release → proximal weakness. Brief exercise increases presynaptic calcium accumulation → more ACh release → temporary improvement in weakness.  \n- **Associations**: Often paraneoplastic (70% linked to small cell lung cancer [SCLC]), explaining weight loss.  \n- **Autonomic dysfunction**: Common (urinary incontinence, dry mouth, constipation, orthostatic hypotension) due to VGCC involvement in autonomic nerves.  \n- **Anticholinesterase resistance**: Ineffective because the problem is presynaptic (not postsynaptic like MG).  \n\n\n### **Other Ruled-Out Conditions**  \n- **MG**: Fatigable weakness (worse with exercise), anticholinesterase-responsive, no autonomic symptoms.  \n- **Polymyositis**: Proximal weakness but no exercise improvement or autonomic dysfunction.  \n\n\n**Answer: Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (likely paraneoplastic, associated with small cell lung cancer)**  \n\n\\boxed{Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome}",

She says she has always been \"large\" and was constantly targeted by her classmates and coworkers for being so. Her main concern at the moment is her acne and unwanted facial hair on her upper lip, for which she often visits a local spa. She has tried numerous diet plans, exercise regimens, and cosmetic products with little to no effect. Recently, she underwent a glucose tolerance test that showed a plasma glucose level of 160 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L) after 2 hours of a 75 g dose of oral glucose.

    "answer": "To address the question about the process involved in regenerating the alveolar lining after damage (as seen in this patient with ARDS from influenza), we focus on the key cellular mechanisms of alveolar repair:\n\n\n### Key Background  \nThe alveolar lining consists of two main epithelial cell types:  \n- **Type I pneumocytes**: Thin, fragile cells that form most of the alveolar surface for gas exchange but are susceptible to damage.  \n- **Type II pneumocytes**: Cuboidal cells that secrete surfactant and act as the **progenitor (stem) cells** of the alveolar epithelium.  \n\n\n### Regeneration Process  \nAfter alveolar damage (e.g., from viral injury in ARDS):  \n1. Damaged Type I cells are lost.  \n2. **Type II pneumocytes proliferate** (divide) to replace the depleted cell population.  \n3. A subset of these proliferating Type II cells **differentiate into Type I pneumocytes** to re-establish the functional gas exchange surface of the alveoli.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe critical process involved in regenerating the alveolar lining is the **proliferation of Type II alveolar epithelial cells and their differentiation into Type I alveolar epithelial cells**.\n\n\n**Answer:** Proliferation of type II alveolar epithelial cells followed by differentiation into type I alveolar epithelial cells.

    "question": "A 65-year-old male is treated for anal carcinoma with therapy including external beam radiation. How does radiation affect cancer cells?",
    "answer": "Radiation therapy (specifically external beam ionizing radiation, like X-rays or gamma rays) exerts its anti-cancer effects primarily through damaging DNA in cancer cells, leveraging their inherent vulnerabilities to induce cell death or permanent growth arrest. Here’s a detailed breakdown:\n\n\n### **1. Direct and Indirect DNA Damage**  \nIonizing radiation interacts with cancer cells in two main ways to disrupt DNA:  \n- **Direct damage**: Radiation particles/photons directly break DNA strands (single-strand breaks, SSBs; or double-strand breaks, DSBs). Double-strand breaks are the most lethal, as they are extremely difficult for cells to repair accurately.  \n- **Indirect damage**: Radiation reacts with intracellular water molecules to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS, e.g., hydroxyl radicals). ROS oxidize DNA bases and cause additional strand breaks, amplifying damage.  \n\n\n### **2. Selective Vulnerability of Cancer Cells**  \nRadiation is more toxic to cancer cells than normal cells because of their unique properties:  \n- **High proliferation rate**: Cancer cells divide rapidly and spend less time in the resting (G0) phase of the cell cycle. They are particularly sensitive during the G2/M (mitosis preparation) and S (DNA synthesis) phases, where DNA damage cannot be easily repaired before division. Normal cells divide slower and are often in G0, making them less susceptible.  \n- **Defective DNA repair**: Many cancer cells have mutations in DNA repair pathways (e.g., p53, BRCA genes) that impair their ability to fix double-strand breaks. Normal cells have intact repair mechanisms, allowing them to survive radiation-induced damage.  \n\n\n### **3. Outcomes for Damaged Cancer Cells**  \nCells with unrepaired or misrepaired DNA face three fates:  \n- **Apoptosis**: Programmed cell death triggered by irreparable DNA damage.  \n- **Mitotic catastrophe**: Cells attempt to divide with broken DNA, leading to catastrophic failure and death.  \n- **Senescence**: Permanent growth arrest (cells stop dividing, even if they don’t die immediately).  \n\nAdditionally, radiation may damage tumor blood vessels, cutting off oxygen and nutrients to the tumor, further suppressing cancer cell survival.\n\n\nIn summary, radiation kills cancer cells by inducing irreversible DNA damage, which is amplified by their high proliferation and defective repair systems—making it a targeted therapy for rapidly growing tumors like anal carcinoma.\n\n\n**Answer:** Radiation therapy (ionizing radiation from external beam) damages cancer cells primarily by inducing irreversible DNA damage, both directly (breaking DNA strands) and indirectly (via reactive oxygen species from water interactions). Cancer cells are selectively vulnerable because they divide rapidly (spending less time in radiation-resistant resting phases) and often have defective DNA repair mechanisms, so they cannot fix critical double-strand DNA breaks. This leads to cell death (apoptosis or mitotic catastrophe) or permanent growth arrest (senescence), eliminating cancer cells while sparing most normal cells (which divide slower and repair DNA better). Secondary effects include damaging tumor blood vessels to cut off nutrient supply.  \n\\boxed{Radiation induces irreversible DNA damage (direct/indirect) in cancer cells, leveraging their high proliferation and defective repair to cause cell death or senescence.}",

Aldosterone acts on the distal nephron to:  \n- Retain sodium (→ hypertension),  \n- Excrete potassium (→ hypokalemia),  \n- Excrete hydrogen ions (→ metabolic alkalosis).  \n\nThe ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) fails to suppress aldosterone in this condition (since aldosterone is autonomous), explaining persistent hypokalemia and resistant hypertension—even with thiazide diuretic use (which can worsen hypokalemia but is unlikely to cause unmitigated alkalosis/resistant HTN when combined with an ACE inhibitor).  \n\n\n**Answer: Primary aldosteronism** (or Conn syndrome).  \n\n\\boxed{Primary\\ aldosteronism}",

    "question": "A 17-year-old girl is referred by her dentist for a suspected eating disorder. She has been visiting the same dentist since childhood and for the past 2 years has had at least 2 visits for dental caries. She eventually admitted to him that she regularly induces vomiting by putting her fingers down her throat. She says she has been doing this for the last few years and purging at least once a week. More recently, she has been inducing emesis more often and even looked into diuretics as she feels that she is gaining more and more weight compared to her ‘skinny friends’. Her BMI is at the 50th percentile for her age and sex. Which of the following features is most consistent with this patient’s condition?",
    "answer": "To determine the most consistent feature of this patient’s condition, we first diagnose her disorder:\n\n\n### Step 1: Diagnose the Eating Disorder  \nThe patient is a 17-year-old girl with:  \n- Recurrent compensatory behaviors (induced vomiting, interest in diuretics) to prevent weight gain.  \n- Normal BMI (50th percentile for age/sex, ruling out anorexia nervosa, which requires low weight).  \n- Self-evaluation focused on body weight/shape relative to peers.  \n\nThis aligns with **Bulimia Nervosa** (DSM-5 criteria: binge-eating + compensatory behaviors ≥1x/week for 3+ months, normal weight, and body image disturbance).\n\n\n### Step 2: Key Features of Bulimia Nervosa  \nCommon physical signs include:  \n- **Parotid gland hypertrophy**: Swollen cheeks due to repeated vomiting (a classic, specific sign).  \n- **Dental erosion**: From stomach acid in vomit (mentioned indirectly via dental caries, but parotid enlargement is a distinct sign).  \n- **Russell’s sign**: Calluses on knuckles from inducing vomiting (possible, but less frequently the \"most consistent\" option in standard questions).  \n- **Electrolyte abnormalities**: Hypokalemia/hypochloremia (not always listed as an option).  \n\nAmenorrhea, lanugo, bradycardia, and low BMI are features of **anorexia nervosa**, not bulimia.\n\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe most consistent feature is **parotid gland enlargement**.\n\n\n**Answer:** Parotid gland enlargement.  \n\n(Note: If \"Russell’s sign\" or \"dental erosion\" were options, they are also correct, but parotid hypertrophy is a highly specific and commonly tested sign for bulimia.)  \n\nAssuming standard options, the answer is **Parotid gland enlargement**.\n\n\n\\boxed{Parotid \\ gland \\ enlargement}",

    "question": "A 22-year-old female college student is treated with metronidazole after presenting to student health services with itching, discharge, and pain in her vagina. At a party shortly afterward she experiences facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps after consuming alcohol. Serum levels of which of the following are likely elevated in this patient following alcohol consumption:",
    "answer": "To determine the elevated serum level, we analyze the scenario:  \n\nThe patient took metronidazole and then consumed alcohol, leading to a **disulfiram-like reaction** (facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, etc.). This reaction occurs because metronidazole inhibits **aldehyde dehydrogenase**, the enzyme responsible for breaking down acetaldehyde (a toxic metabolite of alcohol).  \n\nWhen alcohol is consumed:  \n1. Ethanol is first converted to acetaldehyde via alcohol dehydrogenase.  \n2. Normally, acetaldehyde is rapidly metabolized to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase.  \n3. Metronidazole blocks this second step, causing acetaldehyde to accumulate in the serum.  \n\n\n**Answer: Acetaldehyde**",

    "answer": "To determine the cause of the patient’s laboratory findings, we analyze the key abnormalities and context:\n\n\n### **Key Observations**  \n- **Pregnancy status**: 16 weeks (early second trimester).  \n- **Symptoms**: Increased fatigability.  \n- **CBC abnormalities**: Low reticulocyte count (0.2%, normal = 0.5-1.5%)—indicates **hypoproliferative erythropoiesis** (bone marrow not producing enough RBCs).  \n- **Other values**: Hb (11.1 g/dL) is borderline normal for second trimester (WHO cutoff: <10.5 g/dL = anemia), MCV (90 fL = normocytic), and she is taking folic acid/iron supplements.  \n\n\n### **Critical Analysis**  \nThe low reticulocyte count suggests the bone marrow is not responding appropriately to maintain RBC mass. Since she is already taking iron and folic acid, we need to confirm if these supplements are addressing underlying deficiencies:  \n- **Iron deficiency**: Even with supplementation, iron stores (measured by **serum ferritin**) may be insufficient (e.g., inadequate dose, poor absorption, or unrecognized depletion). Iron deficiency is the most common cause of hypoproliferative anemia in pregnancy, and early iron deficiency can be normocytic (before microcytosis develops).  \n- **Folate deficiency**: Unlikely, as she takes folic acid.  \n- **B12 deficiency**: Usually causes macrocytic anemia (high MCV), which is not present here.  \n\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThe most critical test to investigate the hypoproliferative normocytic anemia is **serum ferritin** to assess iron stores.\n\n\n**Answer: Serum ferritin** (assuming this is an option; if not, the next logical test would be iron studies including ferritin).  \n\n(Note: If options included \"iron studies\" or \"serum ferritin\", that is the correct choice.)  \n\n\\boxed{Serum ferritin}",

    "question": "An 80-year-old man is transferred from a step-down unit to a med-surg floor in the hospital. He had undergone a successful hernia surgery 14 hours ago. Before the surgery, he was pre-treated with atropine, scopolamine, and morphine and recovered well in the PACU after the surgery. There were no complications in the step-down unit and the patient continued to recover. On the med-surg floor, his temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), the heart rate is 98/min, the respiratory rate is 15/min, the blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg, the oxygen saturation is 90%. On physical exam, he is a well-developed, obese man. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. His incision site is clean, dry, and intact with an appropriate level of swelling and erythema. During the physical, the patient mentions some discomfort in his abdomen and pelvis and during a records review it is noted that he has not passed urine in the PACU, step-down unit, or since arriving on the med-surg floor. A bladder scan is inconclusive due to body habitus. What is the next best step in the treatment of this patient?",
    "answer": "The next best step in the treatment of this patient is to perform a straight (in-and-out) urinary catheterization.  \n\n### Rationale:  \nThis patient has high-risk factors for post-operative urinary retention (POUR):  \n1. **Medications**: Preoperative anticholinergics (atropine, scopolamine) and opioids (morphine) relax the bladder detrusor muscle and increase sphincter tone, impairing voiding.  \n2. **Clinical presentation**: No urine output for ≥12 hours (since PACU, step-down, and med-surg stay) with abdominal/pelvic discomfort (consistent with a full bladder).  \n3. **Bladder scan limitation**: Inconclusive due to obesity (body habitus), so we cannot confirm bladder distention via this method.  \n\nStraight catheterization is indicated here to:  \n- **Confirm POUR**: If a large volume of urine (typically ≥300 mL) is retrieved, it confirms retention.  \n- **Relieve obstruction**: Empty the bladder to prevent complications like bladder injury or renal impairment from prolonged retention.  \n\nConservative measures (e.g., encouraging voiding with running water, positioning) are unlikely to succeed given the strong contributors to retention (anticholinergics/opioids) and duration of anuria.

He reports that he noticed a white film on his tongue and the sides of his mouth 2 days ago while brushing his teeth. The film was easily brushed off. He also complains of a bitter metallic taste in his mouth but otherwise denies pain, burning, dysphagia, or hoarseness. He is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. He is a competitive swimmer and has had 8 sexual partners in the past year. He intermittently uses barrier protection. On exam, he is well-appearing and in no acute distress. His oral examination demonstrates patches of white pseudomembranes that can be wiped away to reveal erythematous mucosa. A medication with which of the following mechanisms of action is most appropriate in this patient?",
    "answer": "To answer this question, we first diagnose the patient’s condition and then identify the mechanism of action of the appropriate treatment.\n\n\n### **Step 1: Diagnosis**  \nThe patient presents with **oral candidiasis (thrush)**—key features include:  \n- White pseudomembranes that are easily scraped off, revealing erythematous underlying mucosa.  \n- Risk factors: Multiple sexual partners (intermittent barrier use) suggest possible undiagnosed HIV (a common cause of immunocompromise leading to thrush in young adults).  \n\n\n### **Step 2: Appropriate Treatment & Mechanism**  \nFirst-line treatments for oral candidiasis include **azoles (fluconazole)** or **polyenes (nystatin)**.  \n\n- **Azoles (fluconazole)** are frequently preferred (especially if HIV is suspected, as systemic coverage may be needed).  \n- **Mechanism of action of azoles**: Inhibit fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme **14-α-demethylase**, which is critical for converting lanosterol to ergosterol (a key component of fungal cell membranes). This leads to reduced ergosterol synthesis and impaired cell membrane integrity, killing the fungus.  \n\n- **Polyenes (nystatin)** bind directly to ergosterol, forming pores in the cell membrane—but azoles are more commonly the \"most appropriate\" choice in this context (given potential underlying immunocompromise).  \n\n\n### **Final Answer**  \nInhibition of fungal 14-alpha demethylase (a cytochrome P450 enzyme), resulting in decreased ergosterol synthesis and impaired fungal cell membrane integrity.  \n\n(Note: If phrased as an option, this would correspond to the mechanism of azole antifungals like fluconazole.)\n\n\n**Answer:** Inhibition of fungal 14-alpha demethylase (cytochrome P450 enzyme) leading to reduced ergosterol synthesis.  \n(Formatted as per typical exam responses: \"Inhibits fungal 14-α-demethylase, a cytochrome P450 enzyme, decreasing ergosterol synthesis.\")  \n\nBut to match standard answer formats:  \n**Inhibition of fungal cytochrome P450-dependent 14-alpha demethylase, leading to decreased ergosterol synthesis.**  \n\nOr more concisely:  \n**Inhibition of fungal 14-alpha demethylase (CYP450 enzyme) to reduce ergosterol synthesis.**  \n\n(This is the expected answer for this case.)\n\n\n\\boxed{Inhibition of fungal 14-alpha demethylase, a cytochrome P450 enzyme, leading to decreased ergosterol synthesis}",

He reports that his symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and he has noticed episodes of diarrhea. He recently started melatonin and magnesium supplementation in hopes of improving his sleep. Medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder that required multiple hospital admissions for management of acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis. He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. On hospital day 2, the nurse reports that the patient is oliguric in the setting of constant fluid intake. Physical examination is unchanged.

    "answer": "To determine the best treatment option, we first identify the patient’s current condition by analyzing key clinical findings:\n\n\n### **Step 1: Recognize the Underlying Problem**  \nThe patient has **cirrhosis** (history of alcohol use disorder, ascites, SAAG ≥1.1 g/dL) and recently developed **spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)** (ascitic PMN count >250 cells/mm³). On hospital day 2, he presents with:  \n- Acute kidney injury (AKI): Creatinine increased from 0.9 to 1.8 mg/dL (≥50% rise from baseline).  \n- No nephrotoxic medications, no urine protein/blood, low urine sodium (ruling out intrinsic renal disease).  \n- No improvement with fluid intake (ruling out simple prerenal hypovolemia).  \n\nThis constellation is consistent with **hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-AKI)**—a functional renal failure in cirrhosis caused by splanchnic vasodilation leading to renal hypoperfusion. SBP is a common precipitant of HRS-AKI.\n\n\n### **Step 2: Treatment of HRS-AKI**  \nThe standard treatment for HRS-AKI targets restoring effective arterial blood volume by constricting splanchnic vessels and expanding plasma volume. Guidelines recommend:  \n- **Vasoconstrictor**: Terlipressin (a vasopressin analog) is first-line, as it reduces splanchnic vasodilation.  \n- **Albumin**: To expand intravascular volume (1 g/kg on day 1, then 25-50 g/day).  \n\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThe best treatment option is **terlipressin plus albumin**.\n\n\n**Answer: Terlipressin and albumin** (Note: If terlipressin is unavailable, norepinephrine plus albumin is an alternative, but terlipressin is the first-line choice.)  \n\n(Assuming the option list includes this; since the question asks for the best option, this is the correct answer.)  \n\n\\boxed{Terlipressin and albumin}",

The IgH locus has a strong promoter, so this translocation causes **overexpression of BCL2**.\n\n\n### **Step 3: Role of BCL2**  \nBCL2 is an **anti-apoptotic protein** that normally regulates cell death (apoptosis). Overexpression of BCL2 in follicular lymphoma leads to resistance to apoptosis, allowing abnormal lymphocytes to accumulate and form the non-tender nodules.\n\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nThe most abnormal protein regulation is that of **BCL2**.\n\n\n**Answer: BCL2**",

Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)  \n\n\n### Key Pathophysiology & True Statement  \nThe central cyanosis occurs because **severe pulmonary outflow obstruction raises right ventricular pressure above left ventricular pressure**, leading to a **right-to-left shunt** across the VSD. This shunt bypasses the lungs, resulting in deoxygenated blood entering the systemic circulation.  \n\nA common correct statement about this condition (aligned with standard TOF questions) is:  \n**\"The cyanosis is due to right-to-left shunting across the ventricular septal defect.\"**  \n\nOther potential true statements include:  \n- \"Surgical repair will involve closure of the VSD and relief of pulmonary outflow obstruction.\"  \n- \"The absence of heart failure is because the shunt is right-to-left (not left-to-right, which causes volume overload).\"  \n\n\nAssuming the original question included the option referencing the **right-to-left shunt as the cause of cyanosis**, this would be the correct answer.\n\n\n**Answer:** The cyanosis results from right-to-left shunting across the ventricular septal defect.

    "answer": "To determine the most likely cause of the patient’s condition, we analyze the key clinical features and possible etiologies of her acute confusional state (delirium):\n\n\n### **Key Clinical Features**  \n- 79-year-old post-hip fracture surgery (6 days post-op)  \n- Delirium: Fluctuating alertness (unarousable daytime, awake/impulsive nighttime), inattention, disorientation (place/time), no focal neuro deficits  \n- Minimal alcohol use (1-2 glasses weekly)  \n- Current medication: **oxycodone** (opioid for pain)  \n- Normal vital signs, normal urine dipstick (rules out infection like UTI)  \n\n\n### **Etiology Analysis**  \n1. **Opioid-induced delirium**:  \n   Opioids (e.g., oxycodone) are a common cause of delirium in elderly patients. Elderly individuals have increased CNS sensitivity to opioids and may experience confusion, sleep-wake reversal, and fluctuating alertness—exactly the symptoms here. This is the strongest candidate.  \n\n2. **Alcohol withdrawal**:  \n   Minimal weekly alcohol use (1-2 glasses) does not meet criteria for withdrawal (which requires daily/heavy use). Ruled out.  \n\n3. **Infection**:  \n   Normal urine dipstick (no UTI) and vital signs (no fever) make infection unlikely.  \n\n4. **Anesthesia effects**:  \n   Anesthesia-related delirium resolves within 1-2 days post-op, not 6 days later. Ruled out.  \n\n5. **Metabolic disturbance**:  \n   No evidence of electrolyte imbalance or metabolic derangement (vital signs normal).

Her caretakers state that the patient’s gait suddenly became ataxic, and she became less responsive than her normal non-verbal baseline. Her temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 125/68 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an unremarkable HEENT exam with normal facial features and no signs of airway compromise. Neurological exam is remarkable for new onset spasticity. The patient has 3+ reflexes and a positive Babinski sign. Musculoskeletal exam is only notable for symmetric swelling and deformities of the patient’s hands bilaterally.

    "question": "A 17-year-old female is brought to the emergency room by her father because she has been experiencing shortness of breath and chest pain. She says that the chest pain is worse when she breathes or coughs. Furthermore, on the way to the hospital she noticed that there were specks of blood on a tissue that she coughed into. She has no previous medical history and does not recall anything that could have provoked these symptoms. On presentation her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 107/65 mmHg, pulse is 102/min, respirations are 21/min, and O2 saturation is 91% on room air.

    "answer": "To solve this question, we analyze the patient’s presentation, diagnosis, and key clues step-by-step:\n\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Clinical Diagnosis**  \nThe patient (17yo female) has:  \n- Pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, dyspnea  \n- Filling defect in pulmonary vessels → **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)**  \n\nShe has no obvious risk factors (no surgery, long flight, etc.), so a **hypercoagulable state (thrombophilia)** is likely.\n\n\n### **Step 2: Connect Treatment Response to Underlying Cause**  \nThe appropriate IV treatment for PE is **heparin** (unfractionated heparin, monitored via aPTT). However, the test result (aPTT) was normal—indicating **heparin resistance**.  \n\nHeparin works by potentiating **antithrombin** (a natural anticoagulant that inhibits factors IIa, Xa, etc.). If antithrombin is deficient, heparin cannot exert its effect, so aPTT remains normal. This confirms the underlying cause is **antithrombin deficiency**.\n\n\n### **Step 3: Mode of Inheritance of Antithrombin Deficiency**  \nAntithrombin deficiency (both type 1: quantitative; type 2: qualitative) is **autosomal dominant**.\n\n\n**Answer: Autosomal dominant**\n\n\n\\boxed{Autosomal dominant}",

    "question": "A 26-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with complaints of burning with urination, penile discharge, and intermittent fevers. A urethral smear shows gram negative diplococci within white blood cells. The organism grows well when cultured on Thayer-Martin agar. The patient is prescribed a course of ceftriaxone and the infection resolves without further complication. One year later, the patient returns with the same infection. Which of the following best explains this lack of lasting immunity?",
    "answer": "The lack of lasting immunity is best explained by **antigenic variation of the causative organism (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) surface antigens**.  \n\n\n### Key Explanation:  \nNeisseria gonorrhoeae exhibits high genetic variability in its surface structures, particularly the **pili** (hair-like projections) and **Opa proteins** (outer membrane adhesins). These antigens undergo frequent recombination and mutation (antigenic variation and phase variation), resulting in distinct variants of the bacteria.  \n\nDuring the initial infection, the immune system generates antibodies against the specific surface antigens of the infecting strain. However, subsequent infections involve strains with altered surface antigens that are not recognized by the existing memory B cells or antibodies from the first infection. This constant antigenic shift prevents the development of long-lasting protective immunity, allowing repeated infections.\n\n\n**Answer:** Antigenic variation of the organism’s surface proteins (e.g., pili and Opa proteins) evades the host’s memory immune response.  \n\n(Note: If this were a multiple-choice question, the correct option would align with this concept.)",

    "answer": "To determine the most appropriate next step for this patient, we analyze the clinical scenario using standard trauma guidelines for cervical spine evaluation:\n\n\n### Key Clinical Features  \n- **Mechanism**: Rear-end motor vehicle accident (common for cervical spine injury/whiplash).  \n- **Symptoms**: Significant neck pain (suggests potential midline tenderness) but no neurological deficits (no weakness, numbness, tingling).  \n- **Vitals**: Stable (no hemodynamic compromise).  \n\n\n### Application of Guidelines  \n1. **NEXUS Criteria**: To clear the cervical spine without imaging, all 5 criteria must be met: no midline tenderness, no focal neuro deficit, normal alertness, no intoxication, no painful distraction. The patient’s significant neck pain implies midline tenderness, so **imaging is required**.  \n2. **Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR)**: No high-risk factors (age <65, no dangerous mechanism specified), but the presence of neck pain means we cannot safely assess range of motion. Thus, **imaging is needed**.  \n\n\n### Next Step  \nThe patient requires cervical spine imaging to rule out fractures/dislocations. For trauma patients with potential cervical injury (no neuro deficits), **non-contrast CT scan of the cervical spine** is the first-line imaging modality due to its high sensitivity for bony injuries. Additionally, cervical spine immobilization (collar) should be maintained until imaging confirms no injury.  \n\n\n**Answer**: Apply a cervical collar and perform a non-contrast CT scan of the cervical spine.  \n\n(If forced to choose a single action from typical options, the most appropriate next step is to obtain a CT scan of the cervical spine.)\n\n\n\\boxed{CT scan of the cervical spine}",

    "answer": "To determine which medication is NOT likely the cause of the patient’s galactorrhea and diminished libido (symptoms of hyperprolactinemia), we focus on the mechanism of antipsychotics and their effect on prolactin:\n\n\n### Key Background  \nProlactin release from the anterior pituitary is **inhibited by dopamine** via the tuberoinfundibular pathway. Antipsychotics that strongly block dopamine (D2) receptors in this pathway remove this inhibition, leading to elevated prolactin levels.  \n\n\n### Medication Effects on Prolactin  \n- **Typical antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol):** Potent D2 antagonists → increase prolactin.  \n- **Atypical antipsychotics:**  \n  - **Risperidone/paliperidone:** Potent D2 antagonists → increase prolactin.  \n  - **Aripiprazole:** Unique partial agonist at D2 receptors. It does not fully block dopamine; instead, it acts as a weak agonist in the tuberoinfundibular pathway, preserving dopamine’s inhibitory effect on prolactin. **Thus, it does NOT cause hyperprolactinemia.**  \n\n\n**Answer: Aripiprazole** (assuming it is one of the options; if not, the logic applies to the partial agonist D2 antipsychotic in the choices).\n\n\n\\boxed{Aripiprazole}",
