    "question": "A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?",
    "answer": "To address this scenario, we must prioritize **patient autonomy**, **veracity (truth-telling)**, and **accurate medical documentation**—core ethical principles guiding clinical practice. Here’s the breakdown of the correct next action:\n\n\n### Key Ethical Considerations  \n1. **Patient Autonomy**: The patient has a right to know all relevant details of their care, including unintended complications (even if repaired), to make informed decisions about their recovery.  \n2. **Accurate Documentation**: Omitting the tendon injury from the operative report constitutes **falsification of medical records**, which is unethical and potentially illegal. This information is critical for future providers to understand the patient’s surgical history.  \n3. **Duty to the Patient**: The resident’s primary obligation is to the patient, not the attending. Paternalistic claims (e.g., \"avoid worrying the patient\") do not override the patient’s right to transparency.  \n\n\n### Correct Next Action  \nThe resident should **refuse to omit the complication from the operative report** and **advocate for informing the patient**. If the attending persists in opposing documentation or disclosure, the resident must:  \n- Ensure the complication is clearly documented in the operative report (non-negotiable).  \n- Discuss the ethical imperative of informing the patient with the attending again. If the attending still refuses, the resident may need to inform the patient directly (or escalate to a higher authority, but immediate priority is accurate documentation).  \n\n\n**Final Answer**: The resident should document the complication in the operative report and inform the patient of the event, prioritizing transparency and accurate medical records over the attending’s request to omit the information.  \n\n(Note: In standard exam questions, the most direct correct option aligns with this logic—e.g., \"Refuse to omit the complication from the operative report and inform the patient.\")",

These are sensitive but may have false positives, so a **confirmatory test** is required to confirm infection with high specificity.  \n\n\n### The Confirmatory Test for HIV  \nThe classic (and still widely tested in clinical exams) confirmatory test is the **Western blot**. It works by:  \n1. Separating HIV proteins (e.g., gp120, gp41, p24) by molecular weight using gel electrophoresis.  \n2. Transferring these proteins to a membrane.  \n3. Exposing the membrane to the patient’s serum to detect antibodies that bind to specific HIV proteins.  \n\nA positive Western blot requires antibodies to multiple HIV proteins (e.g., at least two of gp120/gp160, gp41, p24) to confirm infection.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nThe most true statement about the confirmatory test is that it **detects antibodies to multiple specific HIV-encoded proteins** (e.g., gp120, gp41, p24), ensuring high specificity for HIV diagnosis.\n\n\n**Answer:** It detects antibodies to multiple specific HIV proteins (e.g., gp120, gp41, p24).  \n\n(Note: If this aligns with one of the options provided, this is the correct choice.)  \nIf the options include \"Western blot identifies antibodies to specific HIV antigens,\" this is the correct answer.  \nIf the options mention \"HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay\" (a newer confirmatory step), it also detects specific antibodies to distinguish HIV-1 vs HIV-2, but the Western blot is the classic confirmatory test referenced in most standard questions.  \n\nAssuming standard options, the answer is: **It detects antibodies to multiple specific HIV proteins.**  \n(Adjust based on exact options, but this is the core principle.)  \n\n\\boxed{It detects antibodies to multiple specific HIV proteins}  \n\n(If the exact wording in options varies, select the one that reflects this principle.)",

    "question": "A 20-year-old man comes to the physician because of worsening gait unsteadiness and bilateral hearing loss for 1 month. He has had intermittent tingling sensations on both cheeks over this time period. He has no history of serious medical illness and takes no medications. Audiometry shows bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Genetic evaluation shows a mutation of a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 that encodes merlin. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions?",
    "answer": "To answer this question, we first identify the patient’s condition based on the key clinical and genetic clues:\n\n\n### Step 1: Diagnose the underlying syndrome  \nThe patient has:  \n- Bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (classic for vestibular schwannomas).  \n- Gait unsteadiness (vestibular dysfunction or associated tumors).  \n- Genetic mutation: Tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 encoding **merlin** (schwannomin).  \n\nThese findings confirm **Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2)**.\n\n\n### Step 2: Identify NF2-associated increased risks  \nNF2 patients are predisposed to several nervous system tumors beyond bilateral vestibular schwannomas. The most common and classic increased risks include:  \n- **Meningiomas**: Multiple, often aggressive, and frequently occur in NF2.  \n- **Ependymomas**: Especially spinal cord ependymomas.  \n- Schwannomas of other cranial/peripheral nerves (e.g., facial nerve).  \n\n\n### Step 3: Determine the most likely answer  \nIn standard clinical exams (e.g., USMLE), the most frequently tested increased risk in NF2 (beyond vestibular schwannomas) is **meningioma**.\n\n\n**Answer: Meningioma** (assuming this was an option; if ependymoma was an option, it is also a valid risk, but meningioma is more commonly the correct choice in such contexts).  \n\n(Note: If the original options included both, meningioma is the more classic answer.)\n\n\n\\boxed{Meningioma}",

The physician instructs the patient to stand from a supine position with the stethoscope still placed on his chest. Which of the following changes would occur with this maneuver?",
    "answer": "To answer this question, we first identify the murmur and then analyze the effect of the maneuver on it:\n\n\n### Step 1: Identify the murmur  \nThe patient has a **mid-systolic murmur in the 2nd left intercostal space (aortic area) radiating to the carotids**. This is classic for **aortic stenosis (AS)**—a narrowing of the aortic valve that obstructs left ventricular outflow during systole.\n\n\n### Step 2: Effect of standing from supine  \nStanding reduces venous return, leading to a **decrease in preload** (left ventricular end-diastolic volume, LVEDV).  \n\n\n### Step 3: How preload affects AS murmur  \nAS murmur intensity depends on the gradient across the aortic valve and the volume of blood flowing through it. When preload decreases:  \n- LVEDV is smaller, so there is less blood to push through the stenotic valve during systole.  \n- This reduces the pressure gradient across the valve and the flow volume, **decreasing the intensity of the AS murmur**.  \n\n\n**Answer:** The intensity of the murmur decreases.\n\n\n\\boxed{The intensity of the murmur decreases}",

    "question": "A microbiologist is studying the emergence of a virulent strain of the virus. After a detailed study of the virus and its life cycle, he proposes a theory: Initially, a host cell is co-infected with 2 viruses from the same virus family. Within the host cell, concomitant production of various genome segments from both viruses occurs. Ultimately, the different genome segments from the viruses are packaged into a unique and novel virus particle. The newly formed virus particle is both stable and viable and is a new strain from the virus family that caused the outbreak of infection. Which of the following viruses is capable of undergoing the above-mentioned process?",
    "answer": "To answer this question, we first identify the key process described: **genetic reassortment**, which involves the exchange of genome segments between two viruses co-infecting the same host cell, leading to a new viable virus strain. This process only occurs in viruses with **segmented genomes** (since unsegmented genomes cannot swap discrete segments).\n\n\n### Key Background:  \nReassortment is a hallmark of viruses with segmented genomes, as it allows for rapid emergence of novel strains. A classic example is **Influenza A virus** (family Orthomyxoviridae), which has an 8-segmented single-stranded RNA genome. Co-infection of a host (e.g., pig) with human and avian influenza viruses often leads to reassortment, producing new strains that can cause pandemics (antigenic shift).\n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe virus capable of this process is **Influenza virus** (specifically Influenza A, given its role in outbreaks via reassortment).\n\n\n**Answer:** Influenza virus (Influenza A virus)\n\n\n\\boxed{Influenza\\ A\\ virus}",

    "question": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician’s office for a follow-up visit. He was diagnosed with asthma when he was 3 years old and has since been on treatment for the condition. He is currently on a β-agonist inhaler because of exacerbation of his symptoms. He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack. The targeted mediator favors the class switching of antibodies. A reduction in this mechanism will eventually reduce the exaggerated response observed during his asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen. Which of the following mediators is described in this experimental study?",
    "answer": "To determine the targeted mediator, we analyze the key clues from the question:  \n\n### Key Observations:  \n- The boy has **allergic asthma** (symptoms triggered by pollen, a classic allergen).  \n- The experimental therapy targets a mediator that **favors antibody class switching**—critical for allergic responses (specifically switching from IgM to IgE, the antibody driving allergic reactions).  \n\n\n### Mechanism of Class Switching to IgE:  \nAllergic responses depend on IgE, which is produced when B cells undergo class switching from IgM. This switch is primarily driven by **IL-4** (a cytokine secreted by Th2 cells). IL-4 binds to B cells and induces the expression of the IgE heavy chain gene, promoting IgE synthesis.  \n\n\n### Conclusion:  \nAttenuating IL-4 activity reduces IgE production, thereby decreasing mast cell degranulation (and subsequent asthma symptoms) when exposed to allergens.  \n\n\n**Answer: IL-4**\n\n\n\\boxed{IL-4}",

He receives **nebulized albuterol/ipratropium** and **IV methylprednisolone**, then develops **limpness and lethargy**—classic symptoms of **hypokalemia**.  \n\nBeta-2 agonists (e.g., albuterol) cause **intracellular shift of potassium**, leading to hypokalemia. This explains his muscle weakness (limp) and lethargy. His tachycardia (150/min) may also reflect hypokalemia-induced arrhythmia risk.  \n\n\n### **Critical Next Step**  \nBefore initiating potassium replacement, we must **confirm the hypokalemia** with serum electrolyte testing. This ensures appropriate targeted management (e.g., IV potassium if levels are low) and avoids unnecessary interventions.  \n\n\n**Answer: Check serum electrolyte levels** (specifically potassium).  \n\n*(Note: In standard exam options, this corresponds to choosing \"Check serum electrolyte levels\" or equivalent.)*\n\n\n**Final Answer:** Check serum electrolyte levels.  \n\n(If forced to select from typical options, this is the correct choice.)  \n\n\\boxed{Check serum electrolyte levels}",

    "question": "A 5-year-old female suffers from recurrent infections by Aspergillus species, Pseudomonas species, and Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's neutrophils are examined in the laboratory and they fail to react during the nitroblue tetrazolium test. Which of the following is most likely dysfunctional in this patient?",
    "answer": "To solve this question, we analyze the key clinical and laboratory findings and connect them to the underlying cellular dysfunction:\n\n\n### **Key Observations**  \n- Recurrent infections with **Aspergillus** (fungus), **Pseudomonas** (gram-negative), and **Staphylococcus aureus** (gram-positive) — these pathogens require neutrophil-mediated oxidative killing.  \n- **Negative nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test** — this test detects the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by neutrophils. A negative result indicates no ROS generation.  \n\n\n### **Underlying Dysfunction**  \nThe NBT test relies on the **NADPH oxidase complex** to produce superoxide (O₂⁻), which reduces NBT to a blue formazan product. A negative NBT test signifies a failure in this pathway.  \n\nChronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD), caused by mutations in components of the NADPH oxidase complex (e.g., gp91phox, p47phox), results in impaired ROS production. This leads to inability to kill catalase-positive pathogens (like those listed), explaining the recurrent infections.  \n\n\n**Answer: NADPH oxidase complex**\n\n\n\\boxed{NADPH oxidase complex}",

    "question": "A 3-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a ‘cough-like-a-seal bark’ and a high-pitched inspiratory noise that is audible without a stethoscope. His mother reports that his cough has worsened over the last few hours. The patient's blood pressure is 118/78 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, respiratory rate is 35/min, and temperature is 38.3°C (101.1°F). On physical examination, the boy is sitting and leaning forward in apparent respiratory distress with suprasternal and intercostal retractions. Auscultation reveals inspiratory stridor without wheezing. He has a frequent barking cough and a hoarse voice when he speaks. What is a chest X-ray likely to show?",
    "answer": "The patient's clinical presentation (seal-like barking cough, inspiratory stridor, hoarse voice, fever, respiratory retractions) is classic for **croup** (laryngotracheobronchitis), most commonly caused by parainfluenza virus.  \n\nThe characteristic chest X-ray finding in croup is the **steeple sign** (also called the \"pencil-point sign\"). This refers to narrowing of the subglottic trachea on an anteroposterior (AP) view, which resembles the shape of a steeple due to edema of the subglottic mucosa.  \n\n\n**Answer:** Steeple sign (subglottic tracheal narrowing, appearing as a steeple shape on AP chest X-ray).  \n\n\\boxed{Steeple sign}",

    "question": "A 26-year-old woman presents to a gynecologist after a missed period. After performing a complete physical examination and a screening test for pregnancy, her gynecologist informs her that she is pregnant. She is very surprised as she has been taking oral contraceptives regularly. When the gynecologist asks her about the consumption of any other medications, she mentions that she was placed on treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) 2 months ago. Her current anti-TB regimen includes rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the failure of oral contraceptives in this patient?",
    "answer": "To explain the failure of oral contraceptives in this patient, the key mechanism involves **rifampin-induced acceleration of oral contraceptive metabolism**.\n\n\n### Detailed Explanation:  \nOral contraceptives (OCs) typically contain estrogen and progestin, which are metabolized by the **cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system**—specifically CYP3A4.  \n\nRifampin, a first-line anti-tuberculosis medication, is a **potent inducer of CYP450 enzymes** (including CYP3A4). Enzyme induction increases the rate at which OCs are broken down in the liver. This leads to a significant reduction in the blood levels of estrogen and progestin, lowering them below the threshold required to suppress ovulation and maintain contraceptive efficacy.  \n\n\n**Answer:** Rifampin induces cytochrome P450 enzymes, accelerating the metabolism of oral contraceptives and reducing their effective blood levels.  \n\n(If a concise phrase is needed: \"Rifampin-induced CYP450 enzyme induction increasing oral contraceptive metabolism.\")",

    "question": "A 4-year-old previously healthy boy presents with 4 days of intermittent vomiting and 5-6 daily loose stools. His mother noted bloody stools and decreased oral intake of food and water over the last 24 hours. He is normally in daycare; however, he has been home for the past 3 days. On physical exam his temperature is 102.2°F (39°C), blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 22/min and O2 saturation is 99% on room air. He has dry mucous membranes. On abdominal exam you note diffuse tenderness to palpation without rebound or guarding. There are no masses, hepatosplenomegaly, and bowel sounds are hyperactive. Ultrasound of the right lower quadrant is negative for appendicitis. Stool is guaiac positive. He receives 15mg/kg acetaminophen and fluids are started. The next day, he complains of lower extremity weakness and tingling. On repeat exam, lower extremity strength is 3/5 with diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following lab findings would most likely be seen in this patient?",
    "answer": "To solve this question, we analyze the patient’s clinical presentation and link it to the most likely diagnosis and associated lab findings:\n\n\n### **Step 1: Key Clinical Features**  \n- 4-year-old boy with **bloody diarrhea** (preceded by loose stools), fever, dehydration (dry mucous membranes), hypertension (elevated BP for age), and subsequent **neurological symptoms** (lower extremity weakness/tingling, reduced reflexes).  \n- These features point to **Shiga toxin-associated Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)**, a common post-infectious complication of bloody diarrhea (typically caused by *E. coli O157:H7* or *Shigella*).  \n\n\n### **Step 2: Core Lab Findings of HUS**  \nHUS is defined by the triad:  \n1. **Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia**: RBC fragmentation (schistocytes on peripheral smear), low hemoglobin, elevated LDH (from RBC breakdown), and indirect hyperbilirubinemia.  \n2. **Thrombocytopenia**: Low platelet count (due to platelet consumption in microthrombi).  \n3. **Acute renal failure**: Elevated BUN/creatinine (from renal microvascular damage).  \n\n\n### **Step 3: Most Characteristic Lab Finding**  \nThe **presence of schistocytes** (fragmented RBCs) is a specific marker of microangiopathic hemolysis, distinguishing HUS from other causes of anemia/thrombocytopenia. This finding is highly indicative of HUS in this clinical context.\n\n\n**Answer:** Schistocytes on peripheral blood smear.  \n\n(Other possible correct lab findings include thrombocytopenia or elevated serum creatinine, but schistocytes are the most specific for HUS here.)\n\n\n**Final Answer:** Schistocytes on peripheral blood smear.  \n\\boxed{Schistocytes \\ on \\ peripheral \\ blood \\ smear}  \n\n(Note: If options included \"thrombocytopenia\" or \"elevated creatinine,\" those are also correct, but schistocytes are the most characteristic.)  \n\nFor the purpose of standardization (assuming common USMLE-style options), the answer is:  \n\\boxed{Schistocytes \\ present \\ on \\ peripheral \\ smear}",

    "question": "A 3-week-old male newborn is brought to the physician because of an inward turning of his left forefoot. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation by cesarean section because of breech presentation. The pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios. Examination shows concavity of the medial border of the left foot with a skin crease just below the ball of the great toe. The lateral border of the left foot is convex. The heel is in neutral position. Tickling the lateral border of the foot leads to correction of the deformity. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the left foot shows an increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    "answer": "To determine the most appropriate management, we first analyze the key clinical features:\n\n\n### **Key Findings & Diagnosis**  \n- **3-week-old newborn** with **inward forefoot turning** (concave medial border, convex lateral border).  \n- **Neutral heel** (no hindfoot involvement, ruling out clubfoot).  \n- **Flexible deformity**: Corrects with tickling the lateral foot (stimulation).  \n- **X-ray**: Increased angle between 1st and 2nd metatarsals.  \n\nThese findings confirm **flexible metatarsus adductus** (the most common congenital foot deformity). Rigid cases do not correct with stimulation, but this patient’s deformity is flexible.\n\n\n### **Management of Flexible Metatarsus Adductus**  \nMost flexible cases resolve spontaneously or with conservative measures. The first-line intervention is **parental education on gentle stretching exercises** (e.g., abducting the forefoot 10-20 times per session, 3-4 times daily). Serial casting is reserved for rigid cases or those unresponsive to stretching after 3-6 months.\n\n\n**Answer: Parental instruction in passive stretching exercises.** (Note: Exact wording may vary, but the core is stretching exercises.)\n\n\n\\boxed{Parental instruction in passive stretching exercises}",
