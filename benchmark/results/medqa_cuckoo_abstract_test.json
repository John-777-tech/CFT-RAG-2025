    "question": "A 3-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a ‘cough-like-a-seal bark’ and a high-pitched inspiratory noise that is audible without a stethoscope. His mother reports that his cough has worsened over the last few hours. The patient's blood pressure is 118/78 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, respiratory rate is 35/min, and temperature is 38.3°C (101.1°F). On physical examination, the boy is sitting and leaning forward in apparent respiratory distress with suprasternal and intercostal retractions. Auscultation reveals inspiratory stridor without wheezing. He has a frequent barking cough and a hoarse voice when he speaks. What is a chest X-ray likely to show?",
    "answer": "The chest X-ray is likely to show the steeple sign (subglottic tracheal narrowing).\n\nSteeple sign (subglottic tracheal narrowing)",

    "question": "A 26-year-old woman presents to a gynecologist after a missed period. After performing a complete physical examination and a screening test for pregnancy, her gynecologist informs her that she is pregnant. She is very surprised as she has been taking oral contraceptives regularly. When the gynecologist asks her about the consumption of any other medications, she mentions that she was placed on treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) 2 months ago. Her current anti-TB regimen includes rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the failure of oral contraceptives in this patient?",
    "answer": "Rifampin induces cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g., CYP3A4), accelerating the metabolism of oral contraceptive hormones and reducing their efficacy.\n\n**Answer:** Rifampin induces cytochrome P450 enzymes, increasing the metabolism of oral contraceptive hormones.",
    "expected_answer": "Induction of CYP3A4 by rifampin leading to decreased serum levels of ethinylestradiol and progesterone",

    "question": "A 4-year-old previously healthy boy presents with 4 days of intermittent vomiting and 5-6 daily loose stools. His mother noted bloody stools and decreased oral intake of food and water over the last 24 hours. He is normally in daycare; however, he has been home for the past 3 days. On physical exam his temperature is 102.2°F (39°C), blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 22/min and O2 saturation is 99% on room air. He has dry mucous membranes. On abdominal exam you note diffuse tenderness to palpation without rebound or guarding. There are no masses, hepatosplenomegaly, and bowel sounds are hyperactive. Ultrasound of the right lower quadrant is negative for appendicitis. Stool is guaiac positive. He receives 15mg/kg acetaminophen and fluids are started. The next day, he complains of lower extremity weakness and tingling. On repeat exam, lower extremity strength is 3/5 with diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following lab findings would most likely be seen in this patient?",
    "answer": "Schistocytes on peripheral blood smear, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum creatinine (consistent with hemolytic uremic syndrome triggered by bloody diarrhea).  \n\n(Note: The key lab findings for HUS, which is likely here given bloody diarrhea followed by hypertension, neurological symptoms, and renal involvement, include microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes), thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury.)  \n\nSimplified answer: Schistocytes on peripheral smear, low platelets, high creatinine.  \n\nBut to be concise as per request: Schistocytes present on peripheral blood smear.  \n\n(Alternatively, if considering the triad, but the most specific lab is schistocytes.)  \n\nFinal concise answer: Schistocytes on peripheral blood smear.",

    "question": "A 3-week-old male newborn is brought to the physician because of an inward turning of his left forefoot. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation by cesarean section because of breech presentation. The pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios. Examination shows concavity of the medial border of the left foot with a skin crease just below the ball of the great toe. The lateral border of the left foot is convex. The heel is in neutral position. Tickling the lateral border of the foot leads to correction of the deformity. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the left foot shows an increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    "answer": "Instruct the parents to perform gentle stretching exercises of the left forefoot outward.",
