    "question": "A one-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for bilious vomiting. The patient has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium. He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The patient’s mother received routine prenatal care and declined first trimester screening. She subsequently underwent a quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation that demonstrated decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. Her last ultrasound prior to onset of labor demonstrated an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm. The patient’s two older siblings are both healthy.

He also complains of a bitter metallic taste in his mouth but otherwise denies pain, burning, dysphagia, or hoarseness. He is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. He is a competitive swimmer and has had 8 sexual partners in the past year. He intermittently uses barrier protection. On exam, he is well-appearing and in no acute distress.

    "answer": "The most appropriate medication targets fungal cell membranes. A common mechanism is **binding to ergosterol in fungal cell membranes** (e.g., nystatin) or **inhibition of ergosterol synthesis** (e.g., fluconazole), both effective for oral candidiasis. \n\nShort answer: Inhibition of fungal ergosterol synthesis (or binding to fungal ergosterol).  \n\n(Note: The key diagnosis is oral candidiasis, and first-line treatments are antifungals with these mechanisms.)  \n\nFinal answer: Inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis in fungi.",

He reports that his symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and he has noticed episodes of diarrhea. He recently started melatonin and magnesium supplementation in hopes of improving his sleep. Medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder that required multiple hospital admissions for management of acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis. He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone.
