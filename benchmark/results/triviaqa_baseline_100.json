If a single answer is preferred, it often depends on the regional context, but both are correct in their respective markets.\n\n\n**Answer:** Paper Lace and Bo Donaldson & The Heywoods both had 70s No.1 hits with \"Billy, Don't Be A Hero\" (Paper Lace in the UK, Australia, Canada; Bo Donaldson & The Heywoods in the US). For a concise answer, either is acceptable depending on context, but common responses include **Paper Lace** or **Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods**.  \n\n(Note: If the question expects one, often **Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods** is cited for US audiences, while **Paper Lace** for UK/European.)  \n\nBut to cover all bases: **Paper Lace and Bo Donaldson & The Heywoods** are the artists who had 70s No.1 hits with the song.  \n\nHowever, if I have to pick one that's frequently asked, let's go with **Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods** (US No.1) or **Paper Lace** (UK No.1).

Let me confirm with a quick search: yes, for example, some trivia sites list Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods as the answer for the US No.1.
