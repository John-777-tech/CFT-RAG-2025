    "question": "A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of severe abdominal pain and bilious vomiting for 6 hours. He has not had bowel movements in the past 24 hours. He appears ill. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F) and pulse is 122/min. Examination shows a distended abdomen. There is tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen; guarding and rebound tenderness are present. Bowel sounds are decreased. An x-ray of the abdomen shows dilated loops of bowel. He has been accompanied by his 14-year-old brother. The surgeon recommends an emergency laparotomy. The parents are away visiting friends and cannot be reached. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?",
    "answer": "Perform emergency laparotomy.  \n\nReasoning: The child presents with signs of acute bowel obstruction with peritoneal irritation (guarding, rebound tenderness), indicating a potential life-threatening condition (e.g., strangulated obstruction). Since parents are unreachable and the situation is an emergency (delayed intervention risks bowel necrosis, sepsis, or death), the emergency exception to consent applies, and the recommended emergency laparotomy should proceed immediately.  \n\nAnswer: Perform emergency laparotomy.",

An ECG shows no abnormalities, and laboratory testing shows the following:\nLaboratory test\nSerum glucose (fasting)  105 mg/dL\nSerum electrolytes \nSodium  142 mEq/L\nPotassium 3.9 mEq/L\nChloride 101 mEq/L\nSerum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl\nBlood urea nitrogen 10 mg/dl\nCholesterol, total 250 mg/dL\nHDL-cholesterol 35 mg/dL\nLDL-cholesterol 186 mg/dL\nTriglycerides 170 mg/dL\nUrinalysis \nGlucose  negative\nKetones negative\nLeucocytes negative\nNitrites negative \nRed blood cells (RBC) negative \nCasts negative \nWhich of the following lab abnormalities in this patient is an indication for treatment?",
    "answer": "LDL-cholesterol (186 mg/dL)\n\n\n**Explanation:** The patient has multiple cardiovascular risk factors (premature family history of CAD, elevated BP, low HDL, obesity, sedentary lifestyle). An LDL level ≥160 mg/dL in this setting is an indication for pharmacologic treatment (e.g., statins) to reduce cardiovascular risk. Other lab abnormalities (prediabetes, low HDL, high total cholesterol) are managed initially with lifestyle modifications rather than immediate pharmacotherapy.\n\n\nAnswer: LDL-cholesterol (186 mg/dL)",

    "question": "A 26-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was a restrained passenger. On arrival, she is lethargic and incoherent. She has severe facial lacerations and is in respiratory distress. Her pulse is 130/min, respirations are 29/min, and blood pressure is 90/58 mm Hg.
