This aligns with the pattern where each Arabic numeral's corresponding ASCII character (e.g., '0' for numeral 0, '2' for numeral 2) has specific binary and octal values—here, octal 064 and binary 0011 0100 both map to the ASCII character '4', which represents the Arabic numeral 4.  \n\nThis connects the given triples to the Arabic numeral 4, following the established link between Arabic numerals and their ASCII-based binary/octal equivalents.  \n\n**Answer:** The Arabic numeral 4 corresponds to the octal value 064 and the binary value 0011 0100, as these representations align with the ASCII character for the numeral 4, following the pattern where Arabic numerals are linked to their ASCII-based binary and octal equivalents.  \n(Or a more concise version if needed: The Arabic numeral 4 has an octal representation of 064 and a binary representation of 0011 0100, based on the pattern of associating Arabic numerals with their ASCII character's binary and octal forms.)  \n\nBut let's make it precise as per the triples:  \nIn relation to Arabic numerals, the octal value 064 and the binary value 0011 0100 both correspond to the Arabic numeral 4, following the pattern where each Arabic numeral is associated with its ASCII character's respective octal and binary representations.  \n\nYes, that's accurate.  \n\nFinal Answer:  \nThe Arabic numeral 4 corresponds to the octal value 064 and the binary value 0011 0100, as these are the octal and binary representations of the ASCII character for the numeral 4, aligning with the pattern linking Arabic numerals to their ASCII-based binary and octal equivalents.  \n\nOr even more concise (since the user might want a straightforward description):  \nThe Arabic numeral 4 is associated with the octal representation 064 and the binary representation 0011 0100, following the established pattern where Arabic numerals map to their ASCII character's binary and octal values.  \n\nThat's perfect.</think_never_used_51bce0c785ca2f68081bfa7d91973934>The Arabic numeral 4 is associated with the octal representation 064 and the binary representation 0011 0100.
