    "answer": "Ventricular septal defect (VSD)\n\n\n**Explanation (brief):** The infant's presentation (feeding difficulty, listlessness, no cyanosis) plus a high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border is most consistent with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). This is an acyanotic congenital heart defect characterized by a hole in the interventricular septum, leading to left-to-right shunting and the described symptoms.\n\n\nAnswer: Ventricular septal defect (or VSD)",

A medication with which of the following mechanisms of action is most appropriate in this patient?",
    "answer": "Inhibition of fungal ergosterol synthesis (e.g., azole antifungals) or binding to fungal cell membrane ergosterol (e.g., polyene antifungals).  \n\n(Note: The most appropriate mechanism here is typically either blocking ergosterol synthesis via inhibiting lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase (azoles) or disrupting membrane integrity by binding to ergosterol (polyenes), both effective for oral candidiasis.)  \n\nConcise answer: Inhibition of fungal ergosterol synthesis.  \nOr alternatively: Binding to fungal ergosterol to disrupt cell membrane.  \n\nBut given standard practice, the common answer for this scenario is **Inhibition of ergosterol synthesis** (e.g., fluconazole) or **Binding to ergosterol** (e.g., nystatin). Since the question asks for the most appropriate, let's go with the azole mechanism as a common choice:  \n\n**Inhibition of fungal lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase, blocking ergosterol synthesis.**  \n\nBut to be brief as per instruction: **Inhibition of fungal ergosterol synthesis.**  \n\nOr if polyene is preferred: **Binding to fungal cell membrane ergosterol.**  \n\nHowever, the most likely correct answer here (based on typical exam questions) is **Inhibition of ergosterol synthesis.**  \n\nFinal answer: Inhibition of fungal ergosterol synthesis.  \n(Alternatively, if polyene is the intended answer: Binding to fungal ergosterol.)  \n\nBut since the user says answer should be简略, let's pick one concise option:  \n\n**Inhibition of ergosterol synthesis.**  \n或  \n**Binding to fungal ergosterol.**  \n\nBut let's confirm: Oral thrush treatment options include fluconazole (azole, mechanism: inhibit ergosterol synthesis) and nystatin (polyene: bind ergosterol). Both are correct, but let's choose the more commonly tested mechanism in such cases:  \n\n**Inhibition of fungal ergosterol synthesis.**  \n\nThat's the answer.\n</think_never_used_51bce0c785ca2f68081bfa7d91973934>**Inhibition of fungal ergosterol synthesis** (e.g., azole antifungals) or **binding to fungal cell membrane ergosterol** (e.g., polyene antifungals).  \n\nConcise answer: Inhibition of fungal ergosterol synthesis.  \n\n(Note: This is the mechanism of azoles like fluconazole, a common treatment for oral candidiasis, the condition described.)  \n\nFinal answer: Inhibition of fungal ergosterol synthesis.",

    "question": "A 55-year-old truck driver is brought to a physician by his wife. She states that her husband developed a fever and began feeling weak 3 days ago, but has refused medical help. He has been unable to go to work because of his symptoms. The patient has been previously hospitalized for a tricuspid valve replacement surgery 1 year ago and takes aspirin daily. The medical history is also relevant for myocardial infarction 3 years ago and hypertension for the past 10 years, for which he takes lisinopril. His blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, the pulse is 82/min, the respirations are 18/minute, and the temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F).
