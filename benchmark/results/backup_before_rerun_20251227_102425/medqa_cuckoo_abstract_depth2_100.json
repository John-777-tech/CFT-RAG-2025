    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of itchy, watery eyes for the past week. He has also been sneezing multiple times a day during this period. He had a similar episode 1 year ago around springtime. He has iron deficiency anemia and ankylosing spondylitis. Current medications include ferrous sulfate, artificial tear drops, and indomethacin. He works as an elementary school teacher. His vital signs are within normal limits. Visual acuity is 20/20 without correction.

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",
    "answer": "Topical antihistamine drops (e.g., olopatadine) or oral non-sedating antihistamine (e.g., loratadine) are appropriate. Given the systemic sneezing symptoms, oral antihistamine is a good choice to cover both ocular and nasal manifestations. \n\n**Answer:** Oral non-sedating antihistamine (e.g., loratadine) or topical antihistamine drops (e.g., olopatadine). \n\nBut to be concise as per the request: **Topical antihistamine drops** (or if considering systemic symptoms: **Oral antihistamine**). \n\nTaking the most standard concise answer: **Topical antihistamine** (or specific example like Olopatadine). \n\nFinal brief answer: **Olopatadine eye drops** (common topical antihistamine for allergic conjunctivitis) or **Loratadine** (oral). \n\nBut let's pick the most direct: **Topical antihistamine** (since it's targeted for the eye symptoms, though oral also works). Alternatively, **Oral antihistamine** (covers both eye and sneezing). \n\nWait, but let's confirm: For seasonal allergic conjunctivitis with both ocular and nasal symptoms, the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends either topical antihistamines or oral second-generation antihistamines. So either is correct, but let's choose a concise one: **Oral loratadine** or **Topical olopatadine**. \n\nBut since the question asks for the most appropriate treatment, let's go with **Topical antihistamine drops** (as it's directly for the eye symptoms, which are the main complaint here, plus sneezing can be managed with it or oral, but topical is faster for eye relief). \n\nSo the answer: **Topical antihistamine eye drops** (or specific drug name if needed, but concise: **Topical antihistamine**).\n  \n\n**Final Answer:** Topical antihistamine eye drops (e.g., olopatadine)  \n\nBut to make it super brief as per instruction: **Topical antihistamine**\n</answer>**Topical antihistamine eye drops (e.g., olopatadine)** or **oral non-sedating antihistamine (e.g., loratadine)**. For the given scenario, the most appropriate concise answer is:  \n\n**Topical antihistamine**  \n\n(Alternatively, if considering systemic sneezing symptoms: **Oral antihistamine**)  \n\nBut the most targeted treatment for ocular symptoms is **Topical antihistamine eye drops**.  \n\nFinal brief answer:  \n**Topical antihistamine**",

Aspirin is already prescribed, so adding a P2Y12 inhibitor (e.g., clopidogrel) is standard.

In addition, she seems to have less energy compared to other babies and appears listless throughout the day. She was born by cesarean section to a G1P1 woman with no prior medical history and had a normal APGAR score at birth. Her parents say that she has never been observed to turn blue.

    "question": "A 26-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was a restrained passenger. On arrival, she is lethargic and incoherent. She has severe facial lacerations and is in respiratory distress. Her pulse is 130/min, respirations are 29/min, and blood pressure is 90/58 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 70%. Examination shows multiple facial lacerations. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 12.1 g/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows a fractured left second rib, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Traumatic aortic injury (rupture or dissection)\n\n\n**Answer:** Traumatic aortic rupture\n\n\n(Note: The key clue is the widened mediastinum on chest X-ray in a high-speed motor vehicle collision setting, which is highly suggestive of traumatic aortic injury.)",

    "question": "A 26-year-old G1P0 woman presents to her primary care physician’s office with feelings of anxiety and trouble with sleep. She finds it difficult initiating sleep, occasionally has palpitations, and feels fatigued. She denies having similar symptoms in the past or starting any new medications or illicit drugs.

On physical exam, the patient is mildly diaphoretic. The skin is warm and the thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged with thyroid bruits. Laboratory studies are significant for a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.01 µU/mL (normal is 0.5-5.0 µU/mL) and an elevated free thyroxine (FT4) that is inappropriate for her pregnancy.

    "question": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of intermittent loose stools and a 1.2-kg (2.6-lb) weight loss. She immigrated to the US from Uganda 6 weeks ago. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. The liver is firm and palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin, and the spleen is palpable just below the left costal margin. Her leukocyte count is 12,800/mm3 (12% eosinophils). Stool culture shows several oval-shaped eggs with lateral spines. Microscopic examination of a liver biopsy specimen shows granulomatous inflammation with periportal fibrosis.

    "answer": "Schistosoma mansoni\n\nThe patient's presentation (oval stool eggs with lateral spines, eosinophilia, granulomatous liver inflammation with periportal fibrosis, hepatosplenomegaly) and origin from Uganda (endemic area) are consistent with Schistosoma mansoni infection, which is transmitted via contact with contaminated water containing cercariae.\n\n\n**Answer:** Schistosoma mansoni (or if the question expects the exposure source, it would be contaminated freshwater, but given the context of typical exam questions, Schistosoma mansoni is the likely intended answer).  \n\nWait, but since the user said to be简略 (concise), let's just give the pathogen name as the answer. \n\nFinal Answer: Schistosoma mansoni.</think_never_used_51bce0c785ca2f68081bfa7d91973934>Schistosoma mansoni",

An elective primary surgical repair is planned at 4 months of age. Which of the following statements is true about this girl’s condition?",
    "answer": "The girl's condition is Tetralogy of Fallot, characterized by the classic tetrad: severe pulmonary outflow obstruction, right ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular septal defect, and overriding aorta. A key associated feature is cyanotic spells (tet spells) due to transient worsening of pulmonary stenosis leading to increased right-to-left shunting.\n\n\n(Note: Since the original question lacked options, this answer summarizes the core identification of the condition and a common true statement about it.)",

    "answer": "Mental retardation\n\nThe patient's presentation (sudden ataxic gait, upper motor neuron signs like spasticity, 3+ reflexes, positive Babinski, and the \"clunk\" sign indicating atlantoaxial instability) suggests cervical myelopathy due to atlantoaxial instability.
