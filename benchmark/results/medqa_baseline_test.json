    "question": "A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?",
    "answer": "To address this scenario, we must apply core ethical and professional principles: **veracity (truthfulness in documentation and communication), patient autonomy (right to informed decision-making), and integrity in medical record-keeping**. Here’s the correct next action:\n\n\n### Correct Next Action  \nThe resident should **refuse to omit the complication from the operative report** and **advocate for accurately documenting the event**. Additionally, the resident should discuss with the attending the ethical and legal obligation to inform the patient about the complication (even if repaired and no harm is expected), as patients have a right to full transparency about their care.  \n\n#### Rationale:  \n1. **Accurate Documentation**: Medical records must be complete and truthful. Omitting a surgical complication (even a repaired one) constitutes falsification of records, which violates professional standards, hospital policies, and legal requirements.  \n2. **Patient Autonomy**: The patient deserves to know what occurred during their surgery to make informed decisions about follow-up care and understand potential risks (e.g., long-term tendon function, rehabilitation needs).  \n3. **Professional Responsibility**: Residents are obligated to uphold ethical standards even when conflicting with supervisory instructions. If the attending persists in refusing documentation/informed consent, the resident should escalate the issue to a higher authority (e.g., program director, ethics committee) to resolve the conflict.  \n\n\nIn summary, the resident’s immediate priority is to ensure accurate documentation of the complication and advocate for patient transparency.\n\n\n**Answer:** The resident should refuse to omit the complication from the operative report and discuss the need for accurate documentation and patient informed consent with the attending physician. If the attending insists, the resident should escalate the issue to appropriate authorities (e.g., program director) to uphold ethical and legal standards.  \n\n(Note: If this were a multiple-choice question, the correct option would align with these principles—e.g., \"Document the complication in the operative report despite the attending’s instruction\" or \"Discuss the ethical obligation to document and inform the patient with the attending.\")",

The expected beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient's symptoms is most likely due to which of the following actions?",
    "answer": "To answer this question, we first identify the drug responsible for the patient’s symptoms and then its therapeutic mechanism:\n\n\n### Step 1: Identify the causative drug  \nThe patient has transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and now presents with **ototoxicity** (tinnitus + sensorineural hearing loss). This profile points to **cisplatin**—a platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent widely used in bladder cancer and known for ototoxicity (damage to cochlear hair cells).\n\n\n### Step 2: Therapeutic mechanism of cisplatin  \nCisplatin exerts its anticancer effect by **forming covalent cross-links between DNA strands** (intrastrand and interstrand crosslinks). These cross-links block DNA replication and transcription, preventing cancer cells from dividing and leading to apoptosis (cell death).\n\n\n**Answer:** Formation of DNA cross-links (or inhibition of DNA replication/transcription via DNA cross-linking).  \n\n(Note: In standard exam contexts, the expected answer is typically phrased as \"DNA cross-linking\" or \"interstrand/intrastrand DNA cross-link formation.\")\n\n\n**Final Answer:** DNA cross-linking.

    "question": "Two weeks after undergoing an emergency cardiac catherization with stenting for unstable angina pectoris, a 61-year-old man has decreased urinary output and malaise. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the hips. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin and naproxen. He was also started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol after the coronary intervention. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 93/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg.
